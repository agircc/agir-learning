 Preface/Acknowledgments
The latest edition of Oral Pathology: Clinical Pathologic Correlations continues the tradition of presenting oral pa- thology in a clinically relevant format in which diseases and conditions are classified according to their appear- ance and presentation.
What is the benefit of this presentation?
This presentation is designed to assist the student or clini- cian in the recognition of specific conditions and in the development of differential diagnosis and a rational treat- ment approach.
The correlation of histopathology with clinical features of the oral diseases illustrated and discussed further enhances the reader’s understanding of underlying processes. This leads to more skilled diagnoses and improved patient care.
Key Features
• Each chapter begins with a list of diseases or conditions that will be covered. Within the chapter are detailed descriptions of etiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, histopathology, differential diagnosis, and treatment and prognosis of the listed diseases. This matches what the clinician expects to see in practice and makes this book a useful tool for the development of differential diagno- ses and subsequent treatment planning.
• The atlas-style Clinical Overview section covers the most common lesions and symptoms in table format with cor- responding clinical photographs, which facilitates quickly locating key information on each condition described whether at the chairside, in the lab, or as a quick review for exam preparation.
• Over 1,000 high-quality, full-color clinical photographs, radiographs, photomicrographs, and drawings—including advanced imaging and drawings from the authors’ personal collections—clearly illustrate various lesions and disease states.
• Almost 200 boxes and tables on clinical conditions are found throughout the text, and they provide easy access to key information.
Evolve Resources
Student
• 30 case studies demonstrate “unknown” cases. These cases provide excellent opportunities to become more familiar with diagnosing lesions and conditions based on clinical presentation.
• 150 multiple choice questions (created in the Board Re- view format) provide an excellent review for the NBDE. • Each chapter features an accompanying interactive lec-
ture module that walks the student through decision- making practices and proper clinical identification of lesions and conditions. Each module contains case un- knowns in which there are correlations of clinical and radiographic features with histopathology. Also included in each module are summary slides and additional exam- ples of the diseases presented. To further assist in retaining this information, a self-assessment quiz is included at the end of each module.
• 50 image-based questions provide an excellent way to test the reader’s skill at recognition and diagnosis.
Instructor
• An electronic image collection includes all the images from the text. These images are downloadable in various formats to create lectures and class exercises.
• Over 500 multiple choice questions are provided and can be used to create quizzes or final exams. The questions follow the Board Review format.
• Answer Key for Image-based Questions.

Herpes Simplex Infections
 Primary herpetic gingivosto- matitis
 Multiple painful oral ulcers preceded by vesicles; may have similar perioral and skin lesions; fever and gingi- vitis usually present; usually affects children younger than 5 years of age
 Herpes simplex virus type 1 (occasionally type 2)
 Self-limited; heals in about
2 weeks; reactivation of latent virus results in sec- ondary infections; circulating antibodies provide only partial immunity
 Secondary herpes simplex infection
 Multiple small ulcers preceded by vesicles; prodromal symptoms of tingling, burning, or pain at site of developing lesion(s); most common on lip, intraorally on palate and attached gingiva; adults and young adults usually affected; very common; called herpetic whitlow when occurs around fingernail
 Herpes simplex virus: repre- sents reactivation of latent virus and not reinfection; commonly precipitated by stress, sunlight, cold tem- perature, low resistance, and immunodeficiency
 Self-limited; heals in about
2 weeks without scar; lesions infectious during vesicular stage; patient must be cautioned against autoin- oculation; herpes type 1 infections have not been linked convincingly to oral cancer; any site affected in immunosuppressed patients

 Herpes zoster
Unilateral multiple ulcers pre- ceded by vesicles distrib- uted along a sensory nerve course; very painful; usually on trunk, head, and neck; rare intraorally; adults
Reactivation of varicella-zoster virus
Self-limited; may have a pro- longed, painful course (post herpetic neuralgia); seen in debilitation, trauma, neopla- sia, and immunodeficiency
 Hand-foot-and-mouth disease
  Painful ulcers preceded by vesicles on hands, feet, and oral mucosa; usually in children; communicable; oro-fecal transmission; rare
  Coxsackie viruses – (A16, others) (enterovirus family)

 Self-limited; recovery unevent- ful in about 2 weeks; vac- cine available
 Pemphigus vulgaris
 Multiple painful ulcers pre- ceded by bullae; middle age onset; positive Nikolsky sign; progressive; remis- sions or control with therapy; rare
 Autoimmune; antibodies directed against desmo- some-associated protein, desmoglein 3
 Without treatment, may be fatal; significant morbidity from steroid therapy; oral lesions precede skin lesions in over half of cases; prog- nosis improved when treated early
 Mucous membrane pemphigoid
Multiple painful ulcers pre- ceded by vesicles and bul- lae; lesion may heal with scar; positive Nikolsky sign; may affect oral mucous membranes, eyes, and gen- itals; middle-aged or elderly women; uncommon; clini- cally may be confused with lichen planus, chronic lupus erythematosus of gingiva, pemphigus vulgaris and hypersensitivity
Autoimmune; antibodies directed against basement membrane antigens, laminin 332, BP180, others
Protracted course; may cause significant morbidity if severe; ocular scarring may lead to symblepharon or blindness; death uncommon
 Bullous pemphigoid
  Skin disease (trunk and extremities) with infrequent oral lesions; ulcers preceded by bullae; no scarring; elderly persons
  Basement membrane autoan- tibodies detected in tissue and serum
  Chronic course; remissions; uncommon
 Dermatitis herpetiformis
 Skin disease with rare oral involvement; vesicles and pustules; pruritic exacerba- tions and remissions typical; young and middle-aged adults
 Unknown; IgA deposits in sites of lesions; usually associ- ated with gluten enteropathy
 Chronic course that may require diet restriction or drug therapy
 Epidermolysis bullosa
 Multiple ulcers preceded by bullae; positive Nikolsky sign; inheritance pattern determines age of onset during childhood and sever- ity; may heal with scar; pri- marily a skin disease, but oral lesions often present; rare
 Hereditary, autosomal domi- nant or recessive; acquired adult form also exists

Reactive lesions
 Painful ulcer covered by yellow fibrin membrane; diagnosis usually evident from appear- ance when combined with history; common; traumatic factitial injuries are diagnos- tic challenge
 Trauma, chemicals, heat, radiation
 Self-limited; heals in days to weeks; factitial injuries follow unpredictable course
 Syphilis
Primary (chancre): single, indurated, nonpainful ulcer at site of spirochete entry; spontaneously heals in 4-6 weeks
Secondary: maculopapular rash on skin; oral ulcers covered by membrane (mucous patches)
Tertiary: gummas, cardiovas- cular and central nervous system lesions
Congenital: dental abnormali- ties (mulberry molars, notched incisors),
deafness, interstitial keratitis (Hutchinson’s triad)
Spirochete: Treponema pallidum
Primary and secondary forms are highly infectious; mimics other diseases clinically; if untreated, secondary type develops in 2-10 weeks; a minority of patients develop tertiary lesions; latency peri- ods, in which there is no clinically apparent disease seen between primary and secondary stages and between secondary and ter- tiary stages; untreated, 30% progress to tertiary stage
 Gonorrhea
  Typically, genital lesions, with rare oral manifestations, painful erythema or ulcers, or both
  Neisseria gonorrhoeae
  May be confused with many oral ulcerative diseases
 Tuberculosis
Indurated, chronic ulcer that may be painful—on any mucosal surface
Mycobacterium tuberculosis
Lesions are infectious; oral lesions almost always a result of lung lesions; differ- ential diagnosis includes oral cancer and chronic trau- matic ulcer
 Leprosy
  Skin disease, with rare oral nodules/ulcers
  Mycobacterium leprae
  Rare in United States but rela- tively common in Southeast Asia, India, South America
 Actinomycosis
 Typically seen in mandible, with draining skin sinus; wood-hard nodule with yellow, “sulfur” granules
 Actinomyces israelii
 Infection follows entry through a surgical site, periodontal disease, or open root canal

  Viral Disease
Oral mucous membranes may be infected by one of several different viruses, each producing a relatively distinct clini- cal-pathologic picture (Table 1-1). The large family herpes- viridae (or herpesviruses) are structurally similar, character- ized by a large, double-stranded linear DNA core surrounded by a capsid and an envelope. Seven types of herpesviruses are known to be pathogenic for humans, with six of these linked to diseases in the head and neck region.
Herpes Simplex Infection
Herpes simplex virus (HSVs) infections are common ve- sicular eruptions of the skin and mucosa that occur in two forms—primary (systemic) as the result of initial infection in a previously uninfected person and secondary (localized) as the result of viral reactivation in a previously infected individual. Both forms are self-limited in the immunocom- petent host, but recurrences of the secondary form are com- mon because the virus can be sequestered in a latent state within ganglionic tissue. Control of symptoms rather than cure is the usual goal of treatment.
Etiology and Pathogenesis
For a seronegative individual who has not been previously exposed to the virus, or possibly for someone with a low titer of protective antibody to HSV physical contact with an infected individual, exposure to body fluids is the typical route of HSV inoculation and transmission (Figure 1-1). Documentation of the spread of infection through airborne droplets, contaminated water, or contact with inanimate objects is generally undocumented. Fusion of the viral membrane and the host cell membrane is mediated by the sequential binding of cell surface viral glycoproteins to the host cell membrane. This leads to transmembrane cytoplas- mic insertion and sequential activation of specific genes during the lytic phase of infection. These genes include im- mediate early (IE) and early (E) genes, coding for regulatory proteins and for DNA replication, and late (L) genes, coding for structural proteins.
During the primary infection, only a small percentage of individuals show clinical signs and symptoms of infectious systemic disease, whereas a vast majority experience only subclinical disease. The vast majority group, now seroposi- tive, can be identified through laboratory detection of cir- culating antibodies to HSV. The incubation period after exposure ranges from several days to two weeks. In symp- tomatic primary disease, a vesiculoulcerative eruption (pri- mary gingivostomatitis) occurs in the oral and perioral tissues usually at the original site of contact. After resolu- tion of primary herpetic gingivostomatitis, the virus is be- lieved to migrate, through some unknown mechanism, along the periaxonal sheath of the trigeminal nerve to the trigeminal ganglion, where it is capable of remaining in a latent or sequestered state. During latency, no infectious virus is produced; early, but not late, genes are expressed, and no free virus is present. HSV is able to evade host im- mune response by interfering with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen class I presentation on the cell surface that prevents activation of cytotoxic T cells.
Reactivation of virus may follow exposure to sunlight (fever blisters), prior to a cold (cold sores), trauma, menstrual cycle, stress, or immunosuppression causing a secondary or recurrent infection.
An immunocompromised host may develop severe sec- ondary disease. For example, HSV-seropositive patients

being prepared for bone marrow transplants with chemo- therapeutic drugs (conditioning with or without total-body radiation) are at risk for a secondary herpes infection that is particularly severe. Post-transplant chemotherapy also pre- disposes seropositive patients to severe recurrent oral infec- tion. Individuals who are immunocompromised as the result of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection may also exhibit a significantly worse secondary disease. Finally, seronegative patients who are immunosuppressed in preparation for organ transplantation may rarely be affected with herpetic disease.
The reactivated virus, residing dormantly in the trigemi- nal ganglion, travels along the course of the trigeminal nerve to the originally infected epithelial surface, where replication occurs, resulting in a focal vesiculoulcerative eruption. It is believed that nearly all secondary lesions de- velop from reactivated latent virus, although reinfection by different strains of the same subtype is considered a remote possibility.
There are two types of HSV: type 1 (HSV1) typically affects the orofacial region, and type 2 (HSV2) affects the genital region. Most oral-facial herpetic lesions are due to HSV1, although a small percentage may be caused by HSV2 as a result of oral-genital contact. Lesions caused by either virus are clinically indistinguishable. HSV2 infection in the genital region is sexually transmitted but has a pathogenesis similar to that of HSV1 infection of the head and neck. Latent virus, however, is sequestered in the lumbosacral ganglion. Previous HSV1 infection may provide some protection against HSV2 infection because of antibody cross-reactivity.
Viral shedding, a phenomenon in which a previously infected but asymptomatic individual may be capable of transmitting the virus, has been reported, although the re- lationship between frequency of shedding, viral titer, and actual transmission is unknown. Asymptomatic shedding of intact HSV particles in saliva can be identified in approxi- mately 2% to 10% of healthy adults in the absence of clinical disease. The infection risk from “shedders” to others has not been measured, although it is probably low and dependent on the quantity of shed viral particles and the susceptibility of the new host. There was a long-held belief that both HSV1 and HSV2 were causally related to carci- noma of the lip, oral cavity, and uterine cervix, but this belief is no longer supported.
Clinical Features
Primary Herpetic Gingivostomatitis. Primary disease is usually seen in children, although adults who have not been previously exposed to HSV or who fail to mount an appro- priate response to a previous infection may be affected. By age 15, about half the population is infected. The vesicular eruption may appear on the skin, vermilion, and oral mu- cous membranes (Box 1-1 and Figure 1-2). Intraorally, le- sions may appear on any mucosal surface. This is in contrast to the recurrent form of the disease, in which lesions are confined to the lips, hard palate, and gingiva. The primary

lesions are accompanied by fever, arthralgia, malaise, an- orexia, headache, and cervical lymphadenopathy.
After the systemic primary infection runs its course of about 7 to 10 days, lesions heal without scar formation. By this time, the virus may have migrated to the trigeminal ganglion to reside in a latent form. Studies indicate that in the US, the seroprevalence rate for HSV1 is 68% with an equal gender distribution, while for HSV2 the seropreva- lence rate for women is 23% and 11% for men.
Secondary, or Recurrent, Herpes Simplex Infection.
Secondary herpes represents the reactivation of latent virus. It is believed that only rarely does reinfection from an exog- enous source occur in seropositive individuals. The patho- physiology of recurrence has been related to a breakdown in local immunosurveillance or an alteration in local inflam- matory mediators that allows the virus to replicate. Patients usually have prodromal symptoms of tingling, burning, or pain in the site at which lesions will appear. Within a matter of hours, multiple fragile and short-lived vesicles appear. These become unroofed and coalesce to form map-like su- perficial ulcers. The lesions heal without scarring in 1 to 2 weeks and rarely become secondarily infected (Box 1-2; Figures 1-3 to 1-6). The number of recurrences is variable and ranges from one per year to as many as one per month. The recurrence rate appears to decline with age. Secondary lesions typically occur at or near the same site with each

recurrence. Regionally, most secondary lesions appear on the vermilion and surrounding skin. This type of disease is usually referred to as herpes labialis. Intraoral recurrences are almost always restricted to the hard palate or gingiva.
Immunodeficiency. Secondary herpes in the context of immunosuppression results in significant pain and discom- fort, as well as a predisposition to secondary bacterial and fungal infection. In contrast to those occurring in immuno- competent patients, lesions in the immunodeficient patient are atypical in that they can be chronic, destructive, and extensive.
Herpetic Whitlow. Herpetic whitlow is a primary or a secondary HSV infection involving the finger(s) (Figure 1-7) as a complication of primary or genital herpes infection by inoculation of the skin through a break in skin integrity. Before the advent of universal precautions and the

consistent use of examination gloves, this type of infection typically occurred in dental practitioners (the so-called “wet-fingered dentist”) who had been in physical contact with infected individuals. In the case of a seronegative clini- cian, contact could result in a vesiculoulcerative eruption on the digit (rather than in the oral region), along with signs and symptoms of primary systemic disease. Recurrent lesions, if they occur, would be expected on the finger(s). Herpetic whitlow in a seropositive clinician (e.g., one with a history of HSV infection) is believed to be possible, al- though less likely because of previous immune stimulation by herpes simplex antigens.

• Figure 1-6 Secondary herpes simplex infection of the palate.
• Figure 1-7 Herpetic whitlow.
Pain, redness, and swelling are prominent with herpetic whitlow and can be very pronounced. Vesicles or pustules eventually break and become ulcers. Axillary and/or epi- trochlear lymphadenopathy may also be present. The dura- tion of herpetic whitlow is protracted and may be as long as 4 to 6 weeks.
Histopathology. Microscopically, intraepithelial vesicles containing exudate, inflammatory cells, and characteristic
   
www.konkur.in
virus-infected epithelial cells are seen (Figure 1-8). Virus- infected keratinocytes contain one or more homoge- neous, glassy nuclear inclusions that can be found on cytologic preparations. The microscopic appearances of HSV1 and HSV2 are identical and cannot be differenti- ated microscopically. After several days, herpes-infected keratinocytes cannot be demonstrated in biopsy or cyto- logic preparations.
Differential Diagnosis. Primary herpetic gingivostoma- titis is usually apparent from clinical features. It can be confirmed by a virus culture (which requires 2 to 4 days for positive identification). Immunologic methods using monoclonal antibodies or in situ hybridization techniques have become useful for specific virus identification in tissue sections.
Systemic signs and symptoms coupled with the oral ul- cers may require differentiation from streptococcal pharyn- gitis, erythema multiforme, and acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG, or Vincent’s infection). Clinically, strep- tococcal pharyngitis does not involve the lips or perioral tissues, and vesicles do not precede the ulcers. Oral ulcers of erythema multiforme are larger, usually without a vesicular stage, and are less likely to affect the gingiva. ANUG also commonly affects young adults; however, oral lesions are
limited to the gingiva and are not preceded by vesicles. Moreover, considerable pain and oral malodor are often reported with ANUG.
Secondary herpes is often confused with aphthous sto- matitis but can usually be distinguished from it on the basis of clinical features. Multiple lesions, neurologic prodrome (tingling), vesicles preceding ulcers, and palatal and gingival location are indicative of herpesvirus infection. In contrast to herpetic lesions, aphthae are found almost exclusively on nonkeratinized mucosa, such as the floor of the mouth, the alveolar mucosa, and the buccal labial mucosa.
Diagnosis. Several techniques are available to confirm the diagnosis of a primary HSV infection including per- forming a Tzanck smear, serology, viral culture, immuno- histochemistry, or polymerase chain reaction testing. Of note, the use of the Tzanck smear or preparation is helpful only if it is positive.
Treatment. One of the most important factors in the treatment of HSV infection is timing. For any drug to be effective, it must be used as soon as possible after recogni- tion of early or prodromal symptoms. No later than 48 to 72 hours from the onset of symptoms is generally regarded as the ideal time to start therapeutic measures. A number of virus-specific drugs have been developed. Acyclovir and its

analogs have shown the greatest efficacy in the treatment of mucocutaneous infection.
The rationale for the use of topical agents resides in their ability to interrupt viral replication through inhibi- tion of DNA polymerization (acyclovir, penciclovir) or by interference with virus-epithelial interaction and pre- vention of intracellular access by the virus (docosanol). In herpes-infected cells, acyclovir is converted by a viral thymidine kinase to acyclovir triphosphate, a form that competitively inhibits viral DNA polymerase rather than host cell DNA polymerase. The end result is interruption of viral DNA synthesis and relative sparing of cellular DNA synthesis.
Systemic antiviral agents, including acyclovir 400 mg tablets three times per day or valacyclovir 1000 mg twice per day, are effective for control of primary genital herpes and, to a lesser degree, primary oral herpetic gingivostomatitis. Supportive therapy (fluids, rest, oral lavage, analgesics, and antipyret-ics) is an essential component of any primary herpes sim-plex regimen.
Secondary herpes can be controlled to some degree with systemic acyclovir. Recurrences are not prevented, but the course and severity of the disease are favorably affected. Prophylactic systemic acyclovir is effective in problematic cases and in immunosuppressed patients. In HIV-positive patients with severe disease, intravenous acyclovir or ganci- clovir may be necessary.
Topical acyclovir has been advocated by some for the treatment of secondary or recurrent herpes but its effective- ness is limited. A 5% acyclovir (or analog) ointment applied 5 times per day when symptoms first appear slightly reduces the duration of herpes lesions and may abort some lesions. Also, topical n-docosanol (10%) has been used effectively, although randomized clinical trials are lacking. Topical management does not prevent recurrence, however, and may be ineffective in some patients.
Varicella-Zoster Infection
Following introduction of an effective live-attenuated vaccine for varicella-zoster, the incidence of infection in the United States has been reduced by 70% to 90%. In seronegative in- dividuals, primary varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection is known as varicella or chickenpox, while secondary or reacti- vated disease is known as herpes zoster or shingles (Box 1-3). Structurally, VZV is very similar to HSV, with a DNA core, a protein capsid, and a lipid envelope. Microscopically, strik- ing similarities have been noted between VZV and herpes simplex infections. A cutaneous or mucosal vesiculo-ulcer- ative eruption following reactivation of latent virus is typical of both VZV and HSV infections. Several signs and symp- toms, however, appear to be unique to each infection.
Pathogenesis
Varicella. Varicella is believed to be transmitted predomi- nantly through direct contact by contaminated droplets from skin lesions or by the inhalation of aerosolized virus. The condition is very contagious and is known to spread

readily from person to person. During the 2-week incuba- tion period, virus proliferates within macrophages, with subsequent viremia and dissemination to the skin and other organs. Host defense mechanisms of nonspecific interferon production and specific humoral and cell-mediated im- mune responses are also triggered. Overt clinical disease then appears in most individuals. As the viremia over- whelms body defenses, systemic signs and symptoms de- velop. Eventually, in a normal host, the immune response is able to limit and halt the replication of virus, allowing re- covery in 2 to 3 weeks. During the disease process, VZV may progress along sensory nerves to the sensory ganglia, where it can reside in a latent, undetectable form.
Herpes Zoster. Reactivation of latent VZV is uncom- mon but characteristically is associated with a decline in cell-mediated immunity associated with the elderly popula- tion and can follow the presence of an immunosuppressed state resulting from malignancy (especially lymphomas and leukemias), drug administration, or HIV infection. Radia- tion or surgery of the spinal cord or local trauma may also trigger secondary lesions. People are not infectious prior to the early indication of vesicles and are no longer infectious following re-epithelialization of lesions. Prodromal symp- toms of pain or paresthesia develop and persist for several days as the virus infects the sensory nerve of a dermatome (usually of the trunk or head and neck). A vesicular skin eruption will occur, which becomes pustular and eventually ulcerates. The disease generally lasts 2 to 3 weeks and may be followed by a painful post-herpetic neuralgia (in ap- proximately 15% of patients) that takes several months to resolve. Local cutaneous hyperpigmentation may be noted on occasion.
Clinical Features
Varicella. An effective attenuated live vaccine was devel- oped in the mid-1970s by Dr. Michiaki Takahashi of Osaka, Japan, after his son developed chickenpox. With widespread vaccination presently available in developed countries, vari- cella is uncommon. Historically, a large majority of the
 • BOX 1-3
Varicella-Zoster

population experienced primary infection during childhood. Fever, chills, malaise, and headache may accompany a rash that involves primarily the trunk, head, and neck. The rash quickly develops into a vesicular eruption that becomes pus- tular and eventually ulcerates. Successive crops of new le- sions appear, owing to repeated waves of viremia. This causes the presence, at any one time, of lesions at all stages of de- velopment (Figure 1-9). The infection is self-limiting and lasts several weeks. Oral mucous membranes may be in- volved in primary disease and usually demonstrate multiple shallow ulcers that are preceded by evanescent vesicles (Figure 1-10). Because of the intense pruritic nature of the skin lesions, secondary bacterial infection is not uncommon
• Figure 1-9 Varicella eruption on the trunk of a child.
and may result in healing with scar formation. Complica- tions, including pneumonitis, encephalitis, and inflamma- tion of other organs, may occur in a very small percentage of cases. If varicella is acquired during pregnancy, fetal abnormalities may occur. When older adults and immuno- compromised patients are affected, varicella may be much more severe and protracted, and more likely to produce complications.
Herpes Zoster. Zoster is essentially a condition of the older adult population and of individuals who have compromised immune responses. The incidence of herpes zoster infection increases with age, reaching approximately 10 cases per 100,000 patient-years by age 80. The sensory nerves of the trunk and head and neck are commonly af- fected. Involvement of various branches of the trigeminal nerve may result in unilateral oral, facial, or ocular lesions (Figures 1-11 and 1-12). Involvement of facial and auditory nerves produces the Ramsay Hunt syndrome, in which fa- cial paralysis is accompanied by vesicles of the ipsilateral external ear, tinnitus, deafness, and vertigo.
After several days of prodromal symptoms of pain and/ or paresthesia in the area of the involved dermatome, a well- delineated unilateral maculopapular rash appears. This may occasionally be accompanied by systemic symptoms. The rash quickly becomes vesicular, pustular, and then ulcer- ative. Remission usually occurs in several weeks. Complica- tions include secondary infection of ulcers, post-herpetic neuralgia (which may be refractory to analgesics), motor

paralysis, and ocular inflammation when the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve is involved.
Histopathology. The morphology of the VZV and the inflammatory response to its presence in both varicella and herpes zoster are essentially the same as those with HSV. Microscopically, virus-infected epithelial cells show homo- geneous nuclei, representing viral products, with margin- ation of chromatin along the nuclear membrane. Multinu- cleation of infected cells is also typical. Acantholytic vesicles eventually break down and ulcerate. In uncomplicated cases, epithelium regenerates from the ulcer margins with little or no scar.
Differential Diagnosis. Varicella is clinically diagnosed by the history of exposure and by the type and distribution of lesions. Other primary viral infections that may show some similarities include primary HSV infection and hand- foot-and-mouth (HFM) disease.
Herpes zoster is most commonly confused with recur- rent HSV infection and may be indistinguishable from it on clinical grounds. Longer duration, greater intensity of prodromal symptoms, unilateral distribution with abrupt ending at the midline, and post-herpetic neuralgia all favor a clinical diagnosis of herpes zoster. Equivocal cases can be definitively diagnosed through virus antigen typing, DNA hybridization methods, and immunohistochemistry.
Treatment. For varicella in normal individuals, support- ive therapy is generally indicated. However, for immuno- compromised patients, more substantial measures including anti-viral therapies are warranted. Virus-specific drugs that are effective in treating HSV infection have also shown ef- ficacy in the treatment of VZV infection. These include systemically administered acyclovir, vidarabine, and inter- feron. Corticosteroids generally are contraindicated and, when given during the acute phase of the illness, have not been shown to reduce the incidence or severity of post- herpetic neuralgia. A highly effective, live attenuated vac- cine has been available since 1995 and is now routinely given to children. Before the launch of a universal vaccina- tion program, the United States had about 4 million cases of varicella per year; widespread vaccination has resulted in
major reductions in hospitalization, mortality, and burden of disease.
Generally, patients with herpes zoster and intact immune responses have been treated empirically. However, it has been shown that oral acyclovir used at high doses (800 mg 5 3 per day for 7 to 10 days) can shorten the disease course and reduce post-herpetic pain. Analgesics provide only lim- ited relief from pain. Topically applied virus-specific drugs may have some benefit if used early. Topically applied sub- stance P inhibitor (capsaicin) may provide some relief from post-herpetic pain. The use of topical or systemic corticoste- roids cannot yet be recommended, and no evidence supports the use of tricyclic antidepressants or anticonvulsants in the management of herpes zoster. In patients with compro- mised immune responses, systemically administered acyclo- vir, vidarabine, or interferon is indicated, although success is variable.
Hand-Foot-and-Mouth Disease
Etiology and Pathogenesis
One of the subdivisions of the family of viruses known as picornavirus (literally, small “pico” RNA virus) is the Cox- sackie A group, named after the New York state town where the virus was first identified. Certain Coxsackie sub- types cause oral vesicular eruptions: HFM disease and herpangina.
HFM disease is a common, moderately contagious viral infection that usually is caused by Coxsackie type A16 or enterovirus 71, although other serologic types of Coxsackie such as A5, A9, A10, B2, and B5 have been isolated with the disease. The virus is transferred from one individual to another through direct contact with nasal secretions, saliva, blister fluid, or via fecal-oral contamination. With subse- quent viremia, the virus exhibits a predilection for mucous membranes of the mouth (buccal mucosa and tongue) and cutaneous regions of the hands and feet as well as buttocks.
Clinical Features
This viral infection typically occurs in epidemic or endemic proportions and predominantly (about 90%) affects chil- dren younger than 5 years of age. After a short incubation period, the condition resolves spontaneously in 1 to 2 weeks. Signs and symptoms are usually mild to moderate in intensity and include low-grade fever, malaise, lymph- adenopathy, and sore mouth. Pain from oral lesions is often the patient’s chief complaint. Oral lesions begin as vesicles that quickly rupture to become ulcers that are covered by a yellow fibrinous membrane surrounded by an erythematous halo. Lesions, which are multiple, can occur anywhere in the mouth, although the palate, tongue, and buccal mucosa are favored sites, while the lips and gingiva are usually spared. Multiple maculopapular lesions, typically on the feet, toes, hands, and fingers appear concomitantly with or shortly after the onset of oral lesions (Figure 1-13). These cutaneous lesions progress to a vesicular state; they eventu- ally become ulcerated and, finally, minimally encrusted without later scarring.

Histopathology
The vesicles of this condition are found within the epithe- lium because of obligate viral replication in keratinocytes. Eosinophilic inclusions may be seen within some of the infected epithelial cells. As the keratinocytes are destroyed by virus, the vesicle enlarges as it becomes filled with pro- teinaceous debris and inflammatory cells.
Differential Diagnosis
Because this disease may express itself primarily within the oral cavity, a differential diagnosis should include primary herpetic gingivostomatitis and possibly varicella. The rela- tively mild symptoms, cutaneous distribution, and epi- demic spread should help separate this condition from the others. Virus culture or detection of circulating antibodies may be done to confirm the clinical impression.
Treatment
Because of the relatively short duration, generally self- limiting nature, and general lack of virus-specific therapy, treatment for HFM disease is usually symptomatic. In some cases of enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection, severe de- hydration and encephalitis have been reported, stressing the need for monitoring of disease severity. Bland mouth rinses such as sodium bicarbonate in warm water may be used to help alleviate oral discomfort. Some patients may require admission to a hospital if they become dehydrated
because of poor feeding and difficulty in hydrating as a result of painful mouth ulcers.
Herpangina
Etiology and Pathogenesis
Herpangina is an acute viral infection caused by another Coxsackie type A virus (types A1-6, A8, A10, A22, B3, and possibly others). It is transmitted by contaminated saliva and occasionally through contaminated feces.
Clinical Features
Herpangina is a vesicular enanthem (rash on the mucous membranes) and usually endemic, with outbreaks occurring typically in summer or early autumn. It is more common in children aged 3 to 10 than in adults. Those infected gener- ally complain of malaise, fever, dysphagia, and sore throat after a short incubation period. Intraorally, a vesicular erup- tion appears on the soft palate, faucial pillars, and tonsils (Figure 1-14) and persists for 4 to 6 days. A diffuse ery- thematous pharyngitis is also present. No associated exan- thema (skin rash) is typically seen.
Signs and symptoms are usually mild to moderate and generally last less than a week. On occasion, the Coxsackie virus responsible for typical herpangina may be responsible for subclinical infection or for mild symptoms without evi- dence of pharyngeal lesions, particularly among siblings or close contacts of herpangina patients.

The characteristic distribution and short duration of herpangina separate it from other primary viral infec- tions such as herpetic gingivostomatitis, HFM disease, and varicella. The vesicular eruption, described as having mild symptoms, occurring in summer or early autumn, and with diffuse pharyngitis, also distinguishes the condition from streptococcal pharyngitis, and the systemic symptoms dis- tinguish it from aphthous stomatitis. Laboratory confirma- tion can be made by virus isolation or by detection of serum antibodies.
Treatment
Because herpangina is self-limiting, is mild and of short duration, and causes few complications, treatment beyond local measures at times is usually not required.
Measles (Rubeola)
Etiology and Pathogenesis
Measles is a highly contagious viral infection caused by a member of the genus morbillivirus, a member of the para- myxovirus family of viruses. The virus, known simply as measles virus, is an RNA-enveloped virus that is related structurally and biologically to viruses that also cause mumps and influenza. The virus is spread by airborne drop- lets through the respiratory epithelium of the nasopharynx, with peak incidence between March and April. The incuba- tion period is between 7 and 21 days from exposure to on- set with a 1- to 7-day prodromal period. Contagiousness is from 4 days before until 4 days after the onset of the body rash or exanthema.
Typically, the measles rash consists of early pinpoint el- evations over the soft palate that coalesce with ultimate in- volvement of the pharynx with bright erythema; the tonsils may demonstrate bluish-gray areas, so-called Herman spots.
German measles, or rubella, is a contagious disease that is caused by an unrelated virus of the togavirus family. It shares some clinical features with measles, such as fever, re- spiratory symptoms, and rash. However, these features are
very mild and short lived in German measles. In addition, Koplik’s spots (see Clinical Features section) do not appear in German measles. The significance of the German measles virus lies in its ability to cause congenital defects in a devel- oping fetus. The abnormalities produced are varied and may be severe, especially if the intrauterine infection occurs dur- ing the first trimester of pregnancy.
An effective and safe vaccine, the MMR vaccine is a mixture of live attenuated viruses of measles, mumps, and rubella (also called German measles) that is administered via injection to children. A supposed link between the MMR vaccine and autism is unsubstantiated and unproven.
Clinical Features
Because of widespread vaccination programs in developed countries, cases of measles in Western countries are now uncommon, and today those at risk of infection are indi- viduals who have not been vaccinated. Historically, measles was a disease of children, often appearing seasonally in win- ter and spring. After an incubation period, prodromal symptoms of fever, malaise, coryza, conjunctivitis, photo- phobia, and cough develop. In 1 to 2 days, pathognomonic small erythematous macules with white necrotic centers ap- pear in the buccal mucosa (Figure 1-15). These lesion spots of the buccal mucosa, known as Koplik’s spots, after the pediatrician who first described them, herald the onset of the characteristic maculopapular skin rash of measles. Koplik’s spots generally precede the skin rash by 1 to 2 days. Similar lesions may be seen at the conjunctiva at the medial canthus. The rash initially affects the head and neck, fol- lowed by the trunk, and then the extremities. Complica- tions associated with the measles virus include encephalitis and thrombocytopenic purpura. Secondary infection may develop as otitis media or pneumonia.
Histopathology
Infected epithelial cells, which eventually become necrotic, overlie an inflamed connective tissue that contains dilated vascular channels and a focal inflammatory response. Lym- phocytes are found in a perivascular distribution. In lymphoid

tissues and tonsils, large characteristic multinucleated macrophages, known as Warthin-Finkeldey giant cells, are present.
Differential Diagnosis
The diagnosis of measles is usually made on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms in an individual who has not been vaccinated for the disease. Prodromal symptoms, Koplik’s spots, and rash should provide sufficient evidence of measles. If necessary, laboratory confirmation can be made through virus culture or serologic tests for antibodies to measles virus.
Diagnosis
Laboratory criteria for diagnosis include several tests in- cluding positive measles immunoglobulin M (IgM) serol- ogy, immunoglobin G (IgG) seroconversion, isolation of measles virus, or identification by polymerase chain reac- tion testing of measles virus RNA from a clinical specimen.
Treatment.
No specific treatment for measles is known. Supportive therapy of bed rest, fluids, adequate diet, and analgesics generally suffices.
Immunologic Disease
Pemphigus Vulgaris
Pemphigus is a group of autoimmune mucocutaneous diseases characterized by intraepithelial blister formation that results from a breakdown or loss of intercellular kera- tinocyte adhesion, thus producing epithelial cell separa- tion known as acantholysis of the skin and mucous membranes. Widespread superficial ulceration following rupture of the blisters leads to painful debilitation, fluid loss, and electrolyte imbalance. Before the use of cortico- steroids, death was not an uncommon outcome for pa- tients with pemphigus vulgaris secondary to sepsis and loss of electrolytes. Four types of pemphigus are recog- nized: pemphigus vulgaris, pemphigus foliaceus, IgA pem- phigus, and paraneoplastic pemphigus. These differ in the level of intraepithelial involvement in the disease; pemphi- gus vulgaris and pemphigus vegetans subsets affect the suprabasal epithelium, and pemphigus foliaceus affects the upper portion of the prickle cell layer/spinous layer of the skin only. Only pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus vegetans involve the oral mucosa, with or without skin involvement, while paraneoplastic pemphigus is associ- ated with widely distributed mucocutaneous disease pat- terns. Pemphigus vegetans is very rare and generally is considered a clinical variant of pemphigus vulgaris. The term paraneoplastic pemphigus has been historically consid- ered a variant of pemphigus vulgaris in the presence of malignant disease. More recently, however, it has been stated that this entity essentially represents only a single component of a more complex and heterogeneous auto- immune syndrome termed paraneoplastic autoimmune
multiorgan syndrome, where, in addition to surface epi- thelia, including oral mucosal epithelium being targeted, internal organs are likewise affected.
Etiology and Pathogenesis
All forms of the disease retain distinctive presentations, both clinically and microscopically, but share a common autoimmune etiology. Present are circulating autoantibod- ies of the immunoglobulin (IgG) type that are reactive against components of epithelial desmosome-tonofilament complexes. The specific protein target has been identified as desmoglein 3, a transmembrane glycoprotein, one of several proteins in the group of desmosomal cadherin class of cell adhesion molecules (Figure 1-16). Circulating autoantibod- ies are responsible for the earliest morphologic event: the dissolution or disruption of intercellular desmosomal junc- tions and loss of cell-to-cell adhesion. The ease and extent of epithelial cell separation are generally directly propor- tional to the titer of circulating pemphigus antibodies. Historically it was believed that the pemphigus antibody, once bound to the target antigen, activates an epithelial intracellular proteolytic enzyme or group of enzymes that act at the desmosome-tonofilament complex. More recent evidence, however, favors a direct effect of the antibody on the desmoglein structure. Contemporary alternative or supplemental mechanisms have been suggested to explain triggering of acantholysis including induced signal trans- duction events and the concept of antigen-antibody related steric hindrance inhibiting adhesion molecule function. The molecular mechanisms elucidating dysregulation of the immune response leading the cell cleavage and so-called apoptolysis continue to be studied.
In cases of paraneoplastic pemphigus (paraneoplastic autoimmune multiorgan syndrome), disturbances and al- terations are noted both within the surface epithelium and within the basement membrane region. Patients with this syndrome have a lymphoma or other malignancy as the initiating pathology. The underlying malignancy is believed to be responsible for induction of the autoimmune response affecting a wide spectrum of tissue types.
Clinical Features
Lesions of pemphigus vulgaris present as painful ulcers pre- ceded by flaccid and short-lived intraoral vesicles and bullae (Box 1-4 and Figure 1-17). The first signs of the disease ap- pear in the oral mucosa in approximately 70% of cases (Figures 1-18 to 1-21). Such lesions may precede the onset of cutaneous lesions by periods of up to 1 year. Bullae rap- idly rupture following their formation, leaving a red, pain- ful, ulcerated base, with a friable epithelial border or mar- gin. Ulcers range in appearance from small aphthous-like lesions to large, irregular map-like lesions. Gentle traction on clinically unaffected mucosa may produce stripping of epithelium, a positive Nikolsky sign. A great deal of dis- comfort often occurs with confluence and ulceration of smaller vesicles of the soft palate, buccal mucosa, floor of the mouth, and oropharynx.

An increased incidence has been noted in Ashkenazi Jews and in individuals with certain histocompatibility antigen phenotypes (HLA-DR, HLA-A10, HLA-B, HLA-DQB, HLA-DRB1), including

inhabitants of India, the Middle East, and Southeast Europe.
Drug-induced forms of pemphigus vulgaris are noted, in particular with drugs containing thiols such as penicilla- mine and captopril as well as penicillins, cephalosporins,
enalapril, rifampin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
Other autoimmune diseases may occur in association with pemphigus vulgaris, such as myasthenia gravis, lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Hashimoto’s thy- roiditis, thymoma, and Sjögren’s syndrome. A wide range has been noted from childhood to elderly age groups, al- though most cases are noted within the fourth and fifth decades of life.
Histopathology and Immunopathology
Pemphigus vulgaris appears as intraepithelial clefting with keratinocyte acantholysis (Figure 1-22). Loss of desmo- somal attachments and retraction of tonofilaments result in free-floating, or acantholytic, Tzanck cells. Bullae are supra- basal, and the basal layer remains attached to the basement membrane.
In addition to standard biopsy, confirmation of pemphi- gus vulgaris can be made with the use of direct immuno- fluorescence (DIF) testing (Figures 1-23 and 1-24). DIF testing uses a biopsy specimen in an attempt to demonstrate autoantibodies already attached to the tissue. This is prefer- able to less sensitive indirect immunofluorescence, which uses patient serum to identify circulating antibodies. In pemphigus vulgaris, DIF testing of perilesional tissue al- most always demonstrates intercellular autoantibodies of the IgG type. C3 and, less commonly, IgA can be detected in the same intercellular fluorescent pattern. Paraneoplastic

pemphigus demonstrates an antigen-antibody interaction and complement activation producing intraepithelial supra- basal acantholysis, as well as immunoglobulin deposition along the basement membrane zone, leading to severe and intractable stomatitis. Of note, this form of immunopathol- ogy extends to other tissues, including the lungs, heart, bladder, and liver, with autoantibodies attacking or dena- turing components of the cytoplasmic portion of the des- mosome (desmoplakins I and II).
Differential Diagnosis
Clinically, the oral lesions of pemphigus vulgaris must be distinguished from other vesiculobullous diseases, especially mucous membrane pemphigoid, erythema multiforme, erosive lichen planus, paraneoplastic pemphigus, and aph- thous ulcers.
A diagnosis of pemphigus vegetans, a subset of pemphigus vulgaris, may be considered in some situations. Although predominantly a skin disease, the vermilion and intraoral mucosa may be involved, often initially. Early acantholytic
Vesiculobullous Diseases
bullae are followed by epithelial hyperplasia and intraepi- thelial abscess formation. These pustular “vegetations” con- tain abundant eosinophils and can have a verrucous lesion appearance. Pemphigus vegetans–type lesions may also be seen during a lull in the general course of pemphigus vul- garis. Spontaneous remission may occur in pemphigus vegetans, with complete recovery noted—a phenomenon not characteristic of pemphigus vulgaris.
Treatment and Prognosis
The high morbidity and mortality rates previously associ- ated with pemphigus vulgaris have been reduced radically since the introduction of systemic corticosteroids. The re- duction in mortality, however, does carry a degree of iatro- genic morbidity associated with long-term corticosteroid use. The cornerstone of initial pemphigus management is achieved with an intermediate dose of corticosteroid (pred- nisone). For more severely affected patients, a high-dose systemic corticosteroid regimen plus other nonsteroidal im- munosuppressive agents with or without plasmapheresis may be necessary. More recently, immunoadsorption, intra- venous immunoglobulin (IVIg), and biologic agents have gained a place in effective adjunctive management of this disease. A combined drug approach that includes alternate- day prednisone plus a steroid-sparing immunosuppressant agent such as azathioprine, dapsone, mycophenolate, or cyclophosphamide may also be used. A combined drug regimen helps reduce the complications of high-dose ste- roid therapy, such as immunosuppression, osteoporosis, hyperglycemia, and hypertension. Most recently the use of targeted therapy in the form of an anti-CD 20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab) has been very effective in cases of se- vere or unresponsive disease, with effective outcomes.
Topical Steroids. Topical corticosteroids may be used in- traorally as an adjunct to systemic therapy, with a possible concomitant lower dose of systemic corticosteroid. Side ef- fects of topical steroids may occur after prolonged or intense

dermatologic use (Box 1-5). However, with judicious intra- oral use for short periods, it is unlikely that significant sys- temic effects will occur. Because topical steroids can facilitate the overgrowth of Candida albicans orally, antifungal ther- apy may be needed, especially with use of high-potency corticosteroids.
Systemic Steroids. Because the systemic effects and com- plications of glucocorticoids are numerous and can often be profound, it is recommended that they be prescribed by an experienced clinician (Box 1-6). Because the adrenals nor- mally secrete most of their daily equivalent of 5 to 7 mg of prednisone in the morning, all prednisone should be taken, when possible, early in the morning to simulate the physi- ologic process, thus minimizing interference with the pitu- itary-adrenal axis and side effects.
In patients requiring high-dose, prolonged, or mainte- nance steroid therapy, an alternate-day regimen may be used after initial therapy and an appropriate clinical re- sponse. A short-acting steroid (24 to 36 hours), such as prednisone, is desired because it allows recovery or near- normal functioning of the pituitary-adrenal axis on the “off” (no prednisone) days.
The prognosis for patients with pemphigus vulgaris is guarded because of the potentially profound side effects of the drugs used for treatment. Once the disease has been brought under control, a probable lifelong treatment com- mitment to low-dosage maintenance therapy with these drugs will be required. The excellent response to monoclonal antibodies targeting CD20 positive lymphocytes (rituximab) has begun to significantly alter the therapeutic considerations related to pemphigus vulgaris, with a side effect profile more favorable than prolonged high-dose corticosteroids.

Mucous Membrane Pemphigoid
Mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP) is a chronic blis- tering or vesiculobullous disease that affects predomi- nantly oral and ocular mucous membranes (Figures 1-25 to 1-28). It is also known as cicatricial pemphigoid, benign mucous membrane pemphigoid, ocular pemphigus, childhood pemphigoid, and mucosal pemphigoid; when it affects gin- giva exclusively, it has historically been referred to clini- cally as gingivosis or desquamative gingivitis, although these terms are imprecise and not specific because desquamative gingival alterations are common to several other oral mu- cosal diseases.
Etiology and Pathogenesis
MMP is an autoimmune process with an unknown stimu- lus or etiology. Deposits of immunoglobulins and comple- ment components within the basement zone (on DIF testing) are characteristic. Antigenic targets include but are not restricted to laminin 332 (epiligrin, laminin 5) and a 180-kd protein that is also known as bullous pemphigoid antigen 180 (BP180). The specific site of the MMP antigen is in an extracellular location within the lower portion of the lamina lucida component that lies within the basement membrane complex and attachment apparatus. Circulating autoantibodies against basement membrane zone antigens in MMP are usually difficult to detect by routine methods, presumably because of relatively low serum levels.
Clinical Features
This is a disease of adults and the elderly and tends to affect women more than men. MMP has rarely been reported in children. Other mucosal sites that may be involved include the conjunctiva, nasopharynx, larynx, esophagus, and ano- genital region. Oral mucosal lesions typically present as super- ficial ulcers, sometimes limited to attached gingiva (Box 1-7). Bullae are not always observed, as the blisters are fragile and short lived. Lesions are chronic and persistent and may heal with a scar (cicatrix), particularly lesions of the conjunctival surface. Risks include scarring of the canthus (symblepharon), inversion of the eyelashes (entropion), and resultant trauma to the cornea (trichiasis). To prevent corneal damage, many pa- tients with ocular pemphigoid have their eyelashes perma- nently removed by electrolysis. With laryngeal involvement, voice alterations may result from supraglottic stenosis. Cuta- neous lesions are uncommon but usually appear in the head and neck and extremities.
Gingival lesions often present as bright red very friable patches or confluent ulcers extending to unattached gingi- val mucosa with mild to moderate discomfort. Concomi- tant ulcers and erosions may be seen on marginal and attached gingiva. Additionally, lesions may be seen on the buccal mucosa, palate, labial mucosa, and lips.
With chronicity, the pain associated with oral MMP typically diminishes in intensity. Intact epithelium, espe- cially adjacent to ulcers, can often be stripped away with ease, leaving denuded submucosa. This is one of several

mucocutaneous diseases in which a positive Nikolsky sign may be elicited. Because of patient discomfort, routine oral hygiene is often compromised. This results in dental plaque accumulation, which in turn superimposes an additional, but nonspecific, inflammatory response.
• Figure 1-28 Ocular pemphigoid; symblepharon resulting from chronicity.
Histopathology and Immunopathology
MMP is a subepithelial clefting disorder without acantholy- sis. In early stages, few lymphocytes are seen, but over time, the infiltrate becomes more dense and mixed (Figures 1-29 and 1-30).
DIF studies of intact oral mucosa demonstrate a linear pattern of homogeneous IgG fluorescence. C3 is commonly found in the same distribution. Although the fluorescent pattern is not distinguishable from that of cutaneous bul- lous pemphigoid, the submicroscopic or ultrastructural lo- cation of the antigenic target (lower portion of the lamina lucida) is distinctive. Results of indirect immunofluores- cence studies are usually negative, but IgG and, less com- monly, IgA have occasionally been demonstrated.
Differential Diagnosis
The clinical differential diagnosis for this vesiculobullous disease must include pemphigus vulgaris and erosive lichen planus among others (Table 1-2). When the attached gin- giva is the exclusive site of involvement, atrophic lichen

     planus, linear IgA disease, discoid lupus erythematosus, and contact allergy should be included. Final diagnosis will usu- ally require DIF confirmation.
Treatment and Prognosis
Corticosteroids are typically used to control MMP (see Pem- phigus Vulgaris, Treatment and Prognosis section for corti- costeroid effects and side effects). Prednisone is used for moderate to severe disease, and topical steroids for mild disease and maintenance. High systemic corticosteroid doses are occasionally required to achieve significant results in some cases of recalcitrant gingival MMP. Systemic therapy can have undesirable side effects, so high-potency topical steroids are often used instead (e.g., clobetasol, betametha- sone dipropionate, fluocinonide, and desoximetasone). A custom-made, flexible mouth guard may be used to keep the topical medication in place against the gingival mucosa. Scrupulous oral hygiene, including use of chlorhexidine rinses, further enhances the effectiveness of topical cortico- steroids when gingival involvement is marked.
In cases in which standard therapy has failed, or with rapid progression to more severe disease, use of other sys- temic agents may be required. These have included the use of tetracycline, niacinamide, sulfapyridine, sulfones, antibi- otics, gold injections, dapsone, and nutritional supplemen- tation. In severe or refractive cases, and in instances which other sites are affected (eye, esophagus, larynx), immuno- suppressive agents (azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, meth- otrexate, mycophenolate, and cyclosporine) may be added to the prednisone regimen to reduce steroid dose and thus help avoid steroid-associated complications. More recently, adjuvant rituximab has been shown to be effective and well tolerated in recalcitrant or relapsed cases.

18 CHAPTER 1
Vesiculobullous Diseases
Although oral MMP has a relatively benign course, sig- nificant debilitation and morbidity lasting for years can occur. Natural history is unpredictable; in some cases, slow spontaneous improvement may be noted, whereas in other cases, the course may be especially protracted, with alternat- ing periods of improvement and exacerbation.
Of importance for patients with oral MMP is the possi- ble appearance of ocular disease as a result of shared anti- genic determinants with oral mucosa and conjunctiva. If the eyes become affected, definitive early treatment is criti- cal because development of conjunctival ulceration and scarring may lead to blindness. Therefore, ophthalmologic examination should be part of the treatment plan for pa- tients with oral MMP.
Bullous Pemphigoid
Etiology and Pathogenesis
Bullous pemphigoid and its closely related mucosal counter- part, MMP, appear to share similar etiologic and pathogenetic factors. A difference from MMP is that titers of circulating autoantibodies to basement membrane zone antigens are usu- ally detectable in bullous pemphigoid by routine methods.
Autoantibodies have been demonstrated against base- ment membrane zone laminin and so-called bullous pem- phigoid antigens 230 (BP230) and 180 (BP180), which are found in hemidesmosomes and in the lamina lucida por- tion of the basement membrane region. Subsequent to binding of circulating autoantibodies to tissue antigens, a series of events occur, including activation of the comple- ment cascade, which results in attraction and migration of neutrophils and eosinophils to the basement membrane zone. These cells then release lysosomal proteases, which in turn participate in degradation of the basement membrane attachment complex. The final event is tissue separation at the epithelium–connective tissue interface.
Clinical Features
This bullous disease is seen primarily in the elderly, with peak incidence in the seventh and eighth decades. Lesions characteristically appear on the skin, although concomitant lesions of mucous membranes occur in approximately one third of patients.
Skin lesions are characterized by trunk and limb distri- bution. Although tense vesicles and bullae are typically noted in contrast to flaccid bullae of pemphigus vulgaris, they often are preceded by, or associated with, an erythema- tous papular eruption. Oral mucosal lesions of bullous pemphigoid cannot be distinguished from those of MMP. Bullae and erosions may be noted, especially on the at- tached gingiva, a commonly affected site. Other areas of involvement may include the soft palate, buccal mucosa, and floor of the mouth.
Histopathology and Immunopathology
Bullae are subepithelial in location and appear similar to those of MMP. Ultrastructurally, the basement membrane is cleaved at the level of the lamina lucida.
Circulating autoantibody titers neither correlate nor fluctuate with the level of clinical disease, as is usually the case with pemphigus vulgaris. DIF shows linear deposition of IgG and C3 along the basement membrane zone. The major bullous pemphigoid antigen is BP230 in size, and the minor antigen is BP180. Both antigens are synthesized by basal keratinocytes.
Treatment
Periods of clinical remission have been noted with bullous pemphigoid. Systemic corticosteroids generally are used to control this disease. Nonsteroidal immunosuppressive agents may also affect control. Antibiotics (tetracycline and erythromycin) and niacinamide have provided some clinical success. In severe or recalcitrant disease, an expanding role of biologic agents including rituximab has been reported.
Dermatitis Herpetiformis
Etiology and Pathogenesis
Dermatitis herpetiformis is a cutaneous vesiculobullous disease characterized by intense pruritus. The disease is as- sociated with granular IgA deposits in the papillary dermis that precipitate with an epidermal transglutaminase, an enzyme not normally present in the papillary region of normal skin. Serum IgA in patients with dermatitis her- petiformis also binds epidermal transglutaminase. Dermati- tis herpetiformis is frequently associated with the gluten- sensitive enteropathy, celiac disease, which is characterized by IgA-type autoantibodies to a closely related enzyme, tis- sue transglutaminase. It is now widely accepted that derma- titis herpetiformis is a cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease and affects approximately 25% of patients with ce- liac disease, while a similar bullous condition, linear IgA bullous dermatosis, has no association with gluten sensitiv- ity. Both dermatitis herpetiformis and celiac disease are closely linked to HLA class II locus in chromosome 6, with 90% of patients having HLA DQ2, and almost all the re- mainder HLA DQ8. A gluten-free diet is essential in the treatment of both conditions.
Clinical Features
Dermatitis herpetiformis is a chronic disease typically seen in young and middle-aged adults, with a slight male predilec- tion. Periods of exacerbation and remission further character- ize this disease. Cutaneous lesions are papular, erythematous, vesicular, and often intensely pruritic. Lesions are usually symmetric in their distribution over the extensor surfaces, especially the elbows, shoulders, sacrum, and buttocks. Of diagnostic significance is the frequent involvement of the scalp and face. Lesions usually are aggregated (herpetiform), but often are individually disposed. In some patients, exacer- bations may be associated with ingestion of foods or drugs containing iodide compounds. In others, a seasonal (usually the summer months) peak may be seen.
In the oral cavity, dermatitis herpetiformis is uncommon, with vesicles and bullae that rupture, leaving superficial nonspecific ulcers with a fibrinous base with erythematous
 
www.konkur.in
margins. Lesions may involve both keratinized and nonkera- tinized mucosa, and may be seen in a significant number of those with this disease.
Histopathology and Immunopathology
Collections of neutrophils, eosinophils, and fibrin are seen at the papillary tips of the dermis. Subsequent exudation at this location contributes to epidermal separation. A lym- phophagocytic infiltrate is seen in perivascular spaces.
The immunologic finding of granular IgA deposits at the tips of the connective tissue papillae is specific for dermati- tis herpetiformis. In addition, it is possible to localize the third component of complement (C3) in lesional and per- ilesional tissue in a distribution similar to that of IgA.
Treatment and Prognosis
Dermatitis herpetiformis generally is treated with dapsone, sulfoxone, and sulfapyridine. Because patients often have an associated enteropathy, a gluten-free diet may also be part of the therapeutic regimen. Elimination of gluten from the diet reduces small bowel pathology within months.
In most instances, dermatitis herpetiformis is a lifelong condition, often exhibiting long periods of remission. Many patients, however, may be relegated to long-term di- etary restrictions or drug treatment or both.
Linear Immunoglobulin A Bullous Disease (LAD)
Linear IgA bullous disease is principally a chronic autoim- mune disease of the skin that commonly affects mucous membranes, including gingiva. Unlike dermatitis herpeti- formis, LAD is not associated with gluten-sensitive enter- opathy (and may not be responsive to dapsone therapy or dietary gluten restrictions, as is dermatitis herpetiformis). Skin lesions may be urticarial, annular, targetoid, or bul- lous. Oral lesions, present in a majority of cases, are ulcer- ative (preceded by bullae) or erosive, with ocular lesions similar to those noted in ocular pemphigoid. Patients re- spond to sulfones or corticosteroids.
The biological basis of linear IgA disease is not well un- derstood. Central to the disease are autoantibodies to BP180
(collagen XVII), which normally functions as a cell matrix adhesion molecule through stabilization of the hemidesmo- some complex, and whose extracellular portion is constitu- tively shed from the cell surface by ADAMs (proteinases that contain adhesive and metalloprotease domains). Similar to MMP, in vivo and in vitro studies provide experimental evi- dence for a central pathogenic role of BP180, but indicate that the serum level and epitope specificity of these antibod- ies influence phenotype and disease severity. While the vast majority of cases are idiopathic in nature, some cases may be associated with drug exposure, in particular in relation to administration to the antibiotic vancomycin.
Microscopically, separation at the basement membrane zone is seen. Neutrophils and eosinophils often fill the separation (Figure 1-31). With DIF, linear deposits of IgA are found at the epithelium–connective tissue interface.
Linear IgA disease is managed in a similar manner to MMP with dapsone as the initial therapy. Systemic cortico- steroids or other immunosuppressive agents (azathioprine, cyclophosphamide and cyclosporine) or colchicine and sul- fapyridine may be used in more severe or refractory cases.
Hereditary Disease
Epidermolysis Bullosa
Etiology and Pathogenesis
Epidermolysis bullosa is a general term that encompasses one acquired and as many as 20 genetic or hereditary varieties (dystrophic, junctional or simplex) of diseases that are char- acterized by the formation of blisters at sites of minor trauma. Various genetic types range from autosomal domi- nant to autosomal recessive in origin and are further distin- guished by various clinical features, histopathology, and ultrastructure. The acquired nonhereditary autoimmune form, known as epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, is unrelated to the other types and often is precipitated by exposure to specific drugs. In this type, IgG deposits are commonly found in sub–basement membrane tissue and type VII col- lagen (the main constituent of anchoring fibrils) antibodies located below the lamina densa of the basement membrane.

In hereditary forms of epidermolysis bullosa, circulating antibodies are not evident. Rather, pathogenesis appears to be related to genetic defects in basal cells, hemidesmo- somes, or anchoring connective tissue filaments, depending on the disease subtype.
Clinical Features
The feature common to all subtypes of epidermolysis bul- losa is bulla formation from minor trauma, usually over areas of stress such as the elbows and the knees (Figures 1-32 and 1-33). Onset of disease is seen during infancy or early childhood for the hereditary forms, and during adult- hood for the acquired type. Severity is generally greater with the inherited recessive forms. Blisters may be widespread and severe and may result in scarring and atrophy. Nails may be dystrophic in some forms of this disease.
Oral lesions are particularly common and severe in the recessive forms of this group of diseases and uncommon in the acquired form. Oral manifestations include bullae that heal with scar formation, a constricted oral orifice resulting from scar contracture, and hypoplastic teeth. These changes
are most pronounced in recessive forms of dystrophic epi- dermolysis bullosa.
Treatment and Prognosis
The prognosis is dependent on the subtype of epidermolysis bullosa. Behavior ranges from life threatening in one of the recessive forms, known as junctional epidermolysis bullosa, to debilitating in most other forms. Therapy includes avoid- ance of trauma, supportive measures, and chemotherapeu- tic agents (none of which is consistently effective). Cortico- steroids, vitamin E, phenytoin, retinoids, dapsone, and immunosuppressive agents all have been suggested as pro- viding some benefit to patients. More recently, IVIg and the monoclonal biologic agent, infliximab, have been associated with some therapeutic success.

 An ulcer is defined as a loss of epithelium. Ulcers that are preceded by fluid filled blisters, called vesicles or bullae, represent a distinct set of oral conditions that are discussed in Chapter 1. Ulcerative lesions are commonly encountered in dental patients. Although many oral ulcers have similar clinical appearances, their etiologies encompass many disor- ders, including reactive, infectious, immunologic, and neoplastic diseases.
Reactive Lesions
Traumatic Ulcerations
Etiology
Ulcers are the most common oral soft tissue lesions. Most are caused by simple mechanical trauma, and a cause-and- effect relationship is usually obvious. Many are the result of accidental trauma and generally appear in regions that are readily trapped or abraded between the teeth, such as the
lower lip, tongue, and buccal mucosa. A traumatic ulcer in the anterior portion of the tongue of infants with natal and deciduous teeth is known as Riga-Fede disease (or several other eponyms). Prostheses, most commonly dentures, are frequently associated with traumatic ulcers, which may be acute or chronic.
In unusual circumstances, lesions may be self-induced because of an abnormal habit, and in these circumstances there may be an associated psychological problem. These so-called factitial injuries are as difficult to diagnose as they are to treat. They may prove to be frustrating clinical prob- lems, especially if there is no clinical suspicion of a self- induced harm. Psychological counseling may ultimately be required to help resolve the problem.
Traumatic oral ulcers may also be iatrogenic, inadvertently induced by a health care practitioner during a diagnostic, surgical, or medical procedure. Naturally, respect for the fragility of oral soft tissues is of paramount importance in the

Ulcerative Conditions
treatment of patients. Overzealous tissue manipulation or concentration on treating primarily hard tissues may result in accidental, and avoidable, soft tissue injury. Ulcers induced by the removal of adherent cotton rolls, by the negative pressure of a saliva ejector, or by accidental striking of mucosa with rotary instruments are uncommon but entirely preventable.
Chemicals may also cause oral ulcers because of their acid- ity or alkalinity, their ability to act as local irritants, or as contact allergens. These may be patient induced or iatrogenic. Aspirin burns are still seen, although they are increasingly less common. When acetylsalicylic acid is placed inappropriately against mucosa in an attempt by the patient to relieve tooth- ache, a mucosal burn or coagulative necrosis occurs. The ex- tent of injury is dependent on the duration and number of applications. Many over-the-counter medications for tooth- ache, aphthous ulcers, and denture-related injuries have the ability to damage oral mucosa if used injudiciously. Dental cavity medications, especially those containing phenol, may cause iatrogenic oral ulcers. Acidic tooth-etching agents have been associated with chemical burns of mucosa. Endodontic and vital bleaching procedures, which use strong oxidizing agents such as 30% hydrogen peroxide, have also produced burns.
Intraoral ulcers following thermal burns are relatively uncommon intraorally. For example pizza burns, caused by hot cheese, have been noted on the palate. Historically, iatrogenic thermal burns were also seen after injudicious use of thermoplastic tooth impression material or heated com- pound material to fabricate custom denture trays.
Oral ulcerations are common during a course of thera- peutic radiation and with the use of certain types of anti- cancer chemotherapies. In those malignancies, particularly squamous cell carcinoma, that are treated with large (66 to 74 Gy given in 2.0 Gy fractions) doses of radiation, oral ulcers are invariably seen in tissues within the path of the beam. Where chemotherapy is a component of treatment, ulcers have a more widespread distribution within the oral cavity and oropharynx. For malignancies such as lymphoma, in which lower (40 to 50 Gy) doses are used, ulcers are likely but are less severe and of shorter duration. Radiation- induced ulcers persist throughout the course of therapy and for several weeks afterward. If the ulcers are kept clean, spontaneous healing occurs without scarring. Oral mucosi- tis occurs in several phases: (1) an initial phase primarily involving the submucosa and vasculature (2) an epithelial phase, (3) an ulcerative phase, and (4) a healing phase. Early connective tissue changes are associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species and proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-6. Other pathways are also activated including the downregulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that may contribute to increased keratinocyte in- jury and the nuclear factor (NF) kB pathway that results in increased inflammation and apoptosis.
Risk factors for mucositis have not been well estab- lished, but clearly specific cancer treatment protocols and
different chemotherapies produce more mucositis than others. Genetics may also impact the severity of chemo- therapy-induced mucositis. Particularly damaging to oral mucosa are antifolate medication such as methotrexate, which produce their anticancer effects through interfer- ence with nucleotide synthesis. Modifiying the toxicity of methotrexate is the activity of the enzyme 5,10- methy- lenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), which in turn varies with different patient genotypes. Individuals with the MTHFR genotype (CC) show the highest enzyme activity, the heterozygous CT genotype have 60% of the activity of CC genotypes, and the homozygous TT have 30% of the activity of CC types. This means that indi- viduals with the TT genotypes tend to have compara- tively more mucositis than the CC genotypes. The time of the day that chemotherapy is given (chronopharmacol- ogy) may also impact the severity of mucositis and other side effects of chemotherapy. For example, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), commonly used in the treatment of colo-rectal cancer has been shown to have improved effectiveness and reduced toxicity when given at specific times in the day. This chronochemotherapeutic approach has been established for several other anticancer drugs including oxaliplatin, cyclophosphamide, and leucovorin (folinic acid) that are used with methotrexate.
Clinical Features
Acute reactive ulcers of oral mucous membranes exhibit the clinical signs and symptoms of acute inflammation, includ- ing variable degrees of pain, redness, and swelling (Box 2-1; Figures 2-1 to 2-7). The ulcers are covered by a yellow-white fibrinous exudate and are surrounded by an erythematous halo.
Chronic reactive ulcers may cause little or no pain. They are covered by a yellow membrane and are surrounded by elevated margins that may show hyperkeratosis. Induration, often associated with these lesions, is due to scar formation and chronic inflammatory cell infiltration.
Mucosal ulceration related to cancer management starts approximately 10 days following initiation of radiation (at 20 to 30 Gy) and/or chemotherapy. With radiation,

lesions are noted at all sites through which radiation passes, but with chemotherapy, lesions are seen predominantly in movable mucosa (buccal mucosa, lateral and ventral tongue, soft palate, and oropharynx).
A particularly ominous-appearing, but benign chronic ulcer known as traumatic granuloma may be seen in asso- ciation with deep mucosal injury (Figure 2-8). Traumatic granuloma of the oral mucosa is a chronic but self-limiting,

diameter, and healing may take several weeks to a few months. It is usually found in the tongue with an associated inflammatory infiltrate rich in eosinophils, histiocytes, and myofibroblasts. It is likely that this condition is part of a complex and heterogeneous spectrum of disorders that includes several reactive and neoplastic conditions repre- senting the oral counterpart of CD30-positive primary cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders. When there are large numbers of CD30-positive atypical lymphocytes, the term “eosinophil rich-CD30-positive lymphoproliferative disorder” has been suggested.
Another ominous-appearing chronic ulcer, characteristi- cally seen in the hard palate, is known as necrotizing sialo- metaplasia. It is associated with trauma-induced ischemic necrosis of a minor salivary gland and heals spontaneously in several weeks (see Chapter 8).
Histopathology
Acute ulcers show loss of surface epithelium that is replaced by a fibrin network containing predominantly neutrophils (Figure 2-9). The ulcer base contains dilated capillaries and, over time, granulation tissue. Regeneration of the epithe- lium begins at the ulcer margins, with proliferating cells
moving over the granulation tissue base and under the fibrin clot.
Chronic ulcers have a granulation tissue base, with scar found deeper in the tissue. A mixed inflammatory cell infil- trate is seen throughout. Epithelial regeneration occasion- ally may not occur because of continued trauma or because of unfavorable local tissue factors. It has been speculated that these factors are related to inappropriate adhesion mol- ecule expression (integrins) and/or inadequate extracellular matrix receptors for the keratinocyte integrins. In traumatic granulomas, tissue injury and inflammation extend into subjacent skeletal muscle. Here a characteristic dense mac- rophage infiltrate with eosinophils may dominate the histo- logic picture. The term granuloma as used here reflects the large numbers of macrophages that dominate the infiltrate, but this is not a typical granuloma as seen in an infectious process, such as tuberculosis (TB).
Diagnosis
With acute reactive ulcers, the cause-and-effect relationship is usually apparent from the clinical examination and history. When there is a factitial etiology, diagnosis becomes a challenge.

• Figure 2-9 A and B, Chronic ulcer showing fibrin covering an inflamed granulation tissue base.
The cause of chronic reactive ulcers may not be as readily apparent. In this circumstance, it is important that a dif- ferential diagnosis be developed. Both infection (syphilis, TB, deep fungal infection) and malignancy must be consid- ered. If the lesion is strongly suspected to be of traumatic origin, the cause should be determined.
Treatment
Initially, most reactive ulcers may be observed, and having the patient use a bland mucolytic mouth rinse such as sodium bicarbonate in warm water, will help to keep the ulcer clean. If pain is considerable, topical treatment may be beneficial, like a topical corticosteroid. Healing of traumatic granuloma is spontaneous, but topical and intralesional steroids can accelerate healing and reduce symptoms. If the ulcer does not heal within a 2-week period, biopsy should be performed to establish the diagnosis and exclude neopla- sia or infection.
Bacterial Infections
Syphilis
Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease caused by the spirochete bacteria Treponema pallidum. Recognized in Europe since the late 1400s, syphilis was likely already pres- ent in the Americas before the arrival of Christopher Columbus. It was virtually incurable until Dr. Paul Ehrlich developed his “magic bullet,” arsphenamine, around the turn of the twentieth century. A stunning change in the control of syphilis followed the introduction of penicillin in the early 1940s. By then, approximately 600,000 new cases were reported annually in the United States; during the next 15 years, the rate declined to 6000 cases per year. An increase in the number of new cases (peaking to about 50,000 in 1990) is due in part to an association with the incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infec- tion and intravenous drug abuse. A significant number of new cases of syphilis are reported in gay men, having a strong association with HIV coinfection and high-risk sexual behavior. In cases with concurrent HIV disease, an atypical clinical course may be noted, including more severe
constitutional symptoms, necrotic cutaneous ulcerations, organ and ocular involvement, and a greater tendency to develop neurosyphilis.
Etiology and Pathogenesis
Syphilis is caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum (Figure 2-10). It is acquired by sexual contact with a partner with active lesions, by transfusion of infected blood, or by transplacental inoculation of the fetus by an infected mother (Figure 2-11).
When the disease is spread through direct contact, a hard ulcer, or chancre, forms at the site of spirochete entry (Box 2-2). The ulceration is typically deep with a red, brown, or purple base and an irregular raised border, with resemblance to a chronic traumatic ulcer, squamous cell carcinoma, and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. HIV infected patients frequently develop multiple primary lesions. Later, a painless, nonsuppurative regional lymphadenopathy de- velops. The chancre heals spontaneously after several weeks without treatment, leaving the patient with no apparent signs of disease. After a latent period of several weeks, sec- ondary syphilis develops (patients infected via transfusion bypass the primary stage and begin with secondary syphilis)

secondary syphilis may occur in some patients. In about one third of those who have entered the latency phase and have not been treated, tertiary, or late-stage, syphilis devel- ops. These patients may have central nervous system (CNS) involvement, cardiovascular lesions, or focal necrotic in- flammatory lesions, known as gummas, of any organ.
Congenital syphilis occurs during the latter half of preg- nancy, when the T. pallidum organism crosses the placenta from the infected mother. The spirochetemia that develops in the fetus may cause numerous inflammatory and destruc- tive lesions in various fetal organs, or it may cause abortion.
Clinical Features
Primary syphilis results in painless indurated ulcer(s) with rolled margins at the site of inoculation (Box 2-3; Figures 2-12 to 2-15). The lesion does not produce an exu- date. The location is usually on the genitalia. Depending on the site of primary infection, lip, oral, and finger lesions also occur and exhibit similar clinical features. Regional lymph- adenopathy, typified by firm, painless swelling, is also part of the clinical picture. The lesion heals without therapy in 3 to 12 weeks, with little or no scarring.
In untreated syphilis, secondary disease begins after about 2 to 10 weeks. The spirochetes are now disseminated widely and are the cause of a reddish brown maculopapular cutaneous rash and mucosal ulcers covered by a mucoid exudate (mucous patches). Elevated broad-based verrucal plaques, known as condylomata lata, may appear on the skin and mucosal surfaces. Inflammatory lesions may occur in any organ during secondary syphilis.

as a result of hematogenous spread of the spirochete. This stage is marked by a spirochetemia with wide dissemina- tion. Fever, flulike symptoms, mucocutaneous lesions, and lymphadenopathy are typical. In secondary disease, oral lesions are rarely deeply ulcerated, but rather show mucoid exudate (mucous patches). At the labial commissures, split papules may form, while lateral tongue lesions may mani- fest as deep fissures. This stage also resolves spontaneously, and the patient enters another latency period.

Manifestations of tertiary syphilis take many years to ap- pear and can be profound, because there is a predilection for the cardiovascular system and the CNS. Fortunately, this stage of syphilis has become a rarity because of effective antibiotic treatment. In untreated disease, approximately one third of patients progress into a tertiary stage.
Manifestations of neural syphilis include general paresis (paralysis) and tabes dorsalis (locomotor ataxia). Inflamma- tory involvement of the cardiovascular system, especially the aorta, may result in aneurysms. Focal granulomatous lesions (gummas) may involve any organ. Intraorally, the palate is typically affected, which can lead to palatal perfora- tion. Development of generalized glossitis with mucosal atrophy has been well documented in the tertiary stage of this disease. Although patients with so-called syphilitic or luetic glossitis are thought to have an approximately four- fold increased risk of oral squamous cell carcinoma, it is unclear whether this is a result of the disease, or whether it is due to the carcinogenic agents that were formerly used to treat the condition, such as arsenicals and heavy metals.
The generalized spirochetemia of congenital syphilis may result in numerous clinical manifestations that may affect any organ system in a developing fetus. A mucocutaneous

When the infectious process involves the vomer, a nasal deformity known as saddle nose devel- ops; when periostitis of the tibia occurs, excessive anterior bone growth results in a deformity known as saber shin.

Histopathology
The basic tissue response to T. pallidum infection consists of a proliferative endarteritis and infiltration of plasma cells. Endothelial cells proliferate within small arteries and arteri- oles, producing a concentric layering of cells, which results in a narrowed lumen. Plasma cells, along with lymphocytes and macrophages, are typically found in a perivascular dis- tribution. Spirochetes can be demonstrated in the tissues of various lesions of syphilis using silver stains, although they may be scant in tertiary lesions. Immunohistochemistry using an antibody to T. pallidum is available and has largely replaced silver staining for the organism (see Figure 2-10). Gummas may show necrosis and greater numbers of mac- rophages, resulting in a granulomatous lesion that is similar to other conditions, such as TB.
Differential Diagnosis
Clinically, as well as microscopically, syphilis is said to be the great imitator or mimicker because of its resemblance to many other unrelated conditions. When it presents within the mouth, the chancre may be confused with, and must be dif- ferentiated from, squamous cell carcinoma, chronic traumatic lesions, and other infectious diseases, such as TB and histo- plasmosis. The differential diagnosis of secondary syphilis would include many infectious and noninfectious conditions marked by a mucocutaneous eruption. Palatal gummas, al- though rarely seen, may have a clinical appearance similar to the destructive lesions of NK/T-cell lymphoma.
Definitive diagnosis of syphilis is based on laboratory test confirmation of the clinical impression. Among sev- eral tests available are (1) darkfield examination of scrap- ings or exudate from active lesions; (2) special silver stain or immunologic preparation of biopsy tissue; (3) serologic tests for antibodies to T. pallidum, such as the Venereal
Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test, rapid plasmin reagin (RPR), and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent as- say (ELISA), and (4) the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test where patient serum is incubated with antibodies specific for Treponema pallidum species, with greater specificity than non-treponemal tests (e.g. VDRL) where the level of specificity is low in comparison.
Treatment
The drug of choice for treating all stages of syphilis is peni- cillin. Through the years, T. pallidum has remained sensitive to penicillin, as well as to other antibiotics such as erythro- mycin, doxycycline, and tetracycline. A single dose of oral azithromycin is an alternative choice.
Gonorrhea
Etiology
Gonorrhea is one of the most prevalent bacterial diseases in humans. It is caused by the gram-negative diplococcus Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which infects columnar epithelium of the lower genital tract, rectum, pharynx, and eyes. Infection is transmitted by direct sexual contact with an infected part- ner. Containment of the spread of infection in sexual part- ners is enhanced by the short incubation period of less than 7 days, permitting contact tracing, but is hampered by the absence of symptoms in many individuals, especially females.
Genital infections may be transmitted to the oral or pha- ryngeal mucous membranes through orogenital contact. Pharyngeal mucosa is more likely to be infected than oral mucosa because of the type of epithelium and its reduced resistance to trauma, with pharyngitis as the chief complaint. Developing this form of disease is apparently much more likely with fellatio than with cunnilingus. Individuals may have concomitant genital and oral or pharyngeal infections that result from direct orogenital exposure to these areas rather than from being spread through blood or lymphatics.
Transmission of gonorrhea from an infected patient to dental personnel is regarded as highly unlikely because the organism is very sensitive to drying and requires a break in the skin or mucosa to establish an infection. Gloves, protec- tive eyewear, and a mask should provide adequate protec- tion from accidental transmission.
Clinical Features
No specific clinical signs have been consistently associated with oral gonorrhea. However, multiple ulcerations and generalized erythema have been described. Symptoms range from none to generalized stomatitis.
In the more common pharyngeal gonococcal infection, presenting signs are usually seen as general erythema with associated ulcers and cervical lymphadenopathy. The chief complaint may be sore throat, although many patients are asymptomatic.
Differential Diagnosis
Because of the lack of consistent and distinctive oral lesions, other conditions that cause multiple ulcers or generalized
 
www.konkur.in
erythema should be included in a differential diagnosis. Aphthous ulcers, herpetic ulcers, erythema multiforme, pemphigus, pemphigoid, drug eruptions, and streptococcal infection should be considered. Diagnosis of gonorrhea is traditionally based on demonstration of the organism with Gram stain or culture on Thayer-Martin medium. Rapid identification of N. gonorrhoeae with immunofluorescent antibody techniques and other laboratory tests may be used to support clinical impressions.
Treatment
Uncomplicated gonorrhea responds to a single dose of ap- propriately selected antibiotic. In the West, infections are susceptible to penicillins and treatment is effective with a single parenteral dose of 2.0 to 3.5 g of ampicillin. In the Far East and parts of Africa, up to 50% of cases are resistant to penicillins and can be managed with a single 500-mg dose of ciprofloxacin. This regimen is also appropriate for pharyngeal gonorrhea, for which ampicillin is generally in- effective. Concerns have been expressed about the develop- ment of gonococcal resistance to antibiotics. Some strains already have been reported to be resistant to cephalosporins and fluoroquinolone, including multidrug-resistant forms. Thus, fewer treatment options are available.
Tuberculosis
Etiology and Pathogenesis
Tuberculosis infects about one third of the world’s popula- tion and kills approximately 3 million people per year, mak- ing it one of the most significant causes of death in the world. In developed countries, a significant decrease in the incidence of TB has occurred as the result of improvements in living conditions, reductions in overcrowding, and anti- biotic use. However, the 1980s saw a re-emergence of sig- nificant numbers of cases of TB, many in association with
HIV infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), in Europe and Africa. In addition, the issue of multidrug resistance has proved to be a growing problem in management of the disease.
TB is caused by the aerobic, non–spore-forming bacillus Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Figure 2-16). The organism has a thick, waxy coat that does not react with Gram stains but retains the red dyes (Ziehl-Neelsen and Fite tech- niques). With these stains, the organisms do not decolor with acid-alcohol and therefore are also known as acid-fast bacilli. Two major forms of Mycobacterium are recognized: M. tuberculosis and M. bovis. M. tuberculosis is an airborne infection that is transmitted by inhalation of infected drop- lets. M. bovis is primarily a disease of cows that is transmit- ted to humans through infected milk, producing intestinal or tonsillar lesions. Two other closely related forms of Mycobacterium are recognized: M. avium and M. intracel- lulare. Both are nonvirulent in healthy individuals but cause disseminated disease in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV infection.
M. tuberculosis infection is spread through small air- borne droplets, which carry the organism to pulmonary air spaces. Phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages follows, and the battle between bacterial virulence and host resistance begins. The pathogenicity of M. tuberculosis is due both to its ability to resist degradation by macrophages and to the development of a type IV hypersensitivity reaction. This latter feature explains the destructiveness of lesions in the host tissues and the emergence of drug-resistant strains. As the immune system is sensitized by mycobacterial antigens, positive tuberculin reactivity develops. The Mantoux and tine skin tests, which use a tubercle bacillus antigen called purified protein derivative (PPD), determine whether an individual is hypersensitive to antigen challenge. A positive inflammatory skin reaction indicates that the individual’s

cell-mediated immune system has been sensitized and signi- fies previous exposure and subclinical infection. It does not necessarily imply active disease.
A granulomatous inflammatory response to M. tubercu- losis follows sensitization. In most cases, the cell-mediated immune response is able to control the infection, allowing subsequent arrest of the disease. Inflammatory foci eventu- ally may undergo dystrophic calcification, but latent organ- isms in these foci may become reactivated at a later date. In a small number of cases, the disease may progress through airborne, hematogenous, or lymphatic spread, so-called miliary spread.
Oral mucous membranes may become infected through implantation of organisms found in sputum or, less com- monly, through hematogenous deposition. Similar seeding of the oral cavity may follow secondary or reactivated TB.
Clinical Features
Unless the primary infection becomes progressive, an in- fected patient will probably exhibit no symptoms (Box 2-4; Figure 2-17). Skin testing and chest radiographs may provide the only indicators of infection. In reactivated disease,

low-grade signs and symptoms of fever, night sweats, malaise, and weight loss may appear. With progression, cough, he- moptysis, and chest pain (pleural involvement) occur. As other organs become infected a highly varied clinical picture appears and is dependent on the organs involved.
Oral manifestations that usually follow implantation of M. tuberculosis from infected sputum may appear on any mucosal surface. The tongue and the palate are favored loca- tions. The typical lesion is an indurated, chronic, nonheal- ing ulcer that is usually painful. Bony involvement of the maxilla and mandible may produce tuberculous osteo- myelitis. This most likely follows hematogenous spread of the organism. Pharyngeal involvement results in painful ulcers, which may cause dysphagia, odynophagia, and voice changes.
Histopathology
The basic microscopic lesion of TB is granulomatous in- flammation, in which granulomas show central caseous necrosis (Figure 2-18). In tissues, M. tuberculosis incites a characteristic macrophage response, in which focal zones of macrophages become surrounded by lymphocytes and fibroblasts. The macrophages develop an abundant eosino- philic cytoplasm, giving them a superficial resemblance to epithelial cells; for this reason, they are frequently called epithelioid cells. Fusion of macrophages results in the ap- pearance of Langerhans giant cells, in which nuclei are dis- tributed around the periphery of the cytoplasm. As the granulomas age, central necrosis occurs; this is usually re- ferred to as caseous necrosis because of the gross cheesy texture of these zones.
A Ziehl-Neelsen or Fite stain must be used to confirm the presence of the organism in the granulomas, because several infectious and noninfectious conditions may pro- duce a similar granulomatous reaction (Figure 2-19). In the absence of acid-fast bacilli, other microscopic consider- ations would include syphilis, cat-scratch disease, tularemia, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, orofa- cial granulomatosis, sarcoidosis, and some foreign body reactions, such as those induced by beryllium.

Differential Diagnosis
On the basis of clinical signs and symptoms alone, oral TB cannot be differentiated from several other conditions. A chronic indurated ulcer should prompt the clinician to consider primary syphilis and oral manifestations of deep fungal diseases. Noninfectious processes that should be considered clinically are foreign body reaction, sarcoid- osis, Crohn’s disease, orofacial granulomatosis, squamous cell carcinoma, and chronic traumatic ulcer. Major aph- thae might be included, although a history of recurrent disease should help separate this condition from the oth- ers. In approximately half of cases, the diagnosis or oral manifestation of oral tuberculosis has led to a diagnosis of undiagnosed systemic infection. Rarely, carcinomas may coexist at the same lesion site.
Treatment
First-line drugs likely to be used for treatment of TB in- clude isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Drug combinations are often used in 6-, 9-, or 12-month treatment regimens, which may be continued for as long as 2 years. Streptomycin is rarely used for first-line treat- ment except in multidrug-resistant cases. Oral lesions would be expected to resolve with treatment of the pa- tient’s systemic disease. Unfortunately, infection with multidrug-resistant organisms is a serious clinical problem that appears to be on the increase. Development and test- ing of new classes of drugs are necessary to meet the chal- lenge of resistant organisms.
Patients who convert from a negative to a positive skin test response may benefit from prophylactic chemotherapy, typically using isoniazid for 1 year. This decision is depen- dent on risk factors involved, such as age and immune sta- tus, and on the opinion of the attending physician.
Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is effective in controlling childhood TB, but it loses efficacy in adulthood. New vaccines that are under investigation offer hope for at-risk populations.
Leprosy
Etiology and Pathogenesis
Leprosy, also known as Hansen’s disease, is a chronic infectious disease caused by the acid-fast bacilli Mycobacte- rium leprae and Mycobacterium lepromatosis. Worldwide, 20 million individuals are estimated to be infected. It is the most common cause of peripheral neuritis in the world. Because the causative organisms are difficult to grow in cul- ture, these infections continue to be cultivated in the foot- pads of mice and in the armadillo, which has a low core body temperature. Leprosy is only moderately contagious; transmission of the disease requires frequent direct contact with an infected individual for a long period, with an incu- bation period ranging up to 5 years for the tuberculoid form versus up to 12 years in the lepromatous form of the disease. Inoculation through the respiratory tract is believed to be a potential mode of transmission.
Clinical Features
Oral lesions appear in the lepromatous form of the disease in 20% to 60% of cases, as multiple nodules (necrotic and ul- cerated), with associated slow healing and atrophic scarring. A clinical spectrum of disease ranges from a limited form (tuberculoid leprosy) in those with a well-functioning im- mune system, to a generalized form (lepromatous leprosy) in individuals with reduced levels of cell-mediated immune re- activity; immunocompromised individuals have a more seri- ously damaging course. Generally, skin and peripheral nerves are affected because the organism grows best in temperatures less than the core body temperature of 37 degrees C. Cutane- ous lesions appear as erythematous plaques or nodules, repre- senting a granulomatous response to the organism. Similar lesions may occur intraorally or intranasally. In time, severe maxillofacial deformities may appear, producing the classic destruction of the anterior nasal spine and anterior maxillary alveolus, as well as intranasal inflammation and tissue de- struction called facies leprosa. Damage to peripheral nerves results in anesthesia, leading to trauma to the extremities and consequent ulceration, as well as bone resorption.
Histopathology
Microscopically, a granulomatous inflammatory response, in which macrophages/epithelioid histiocytes and multi- nucleated giant cells predominate, is usually seen. Infiltra- tion of nerves by mononuclear inflammatory cells is also noted. Well-formed granulomas, similar to those present in the tissue lesions of TB, are typically seen in tuberculoid leprosy. Poorly formed granulomas with sheets of macro- phages reflect the pattern more typical of leproid leprosy. Acid-fast bacilli can be found within macrophages and are best demonstrated with the Fite stain. Organisms are most numerous in the lepromatous form of leprosy.
Diagnosis
A history of contact with a known infected patient or of living in a known endemic area is important for establishing
 33

34 CHAPTER 2
Ulcerative Conditions
a diagnosis. Signs and symptoms associated with skin and nerve involvement should provide additional clues to the nature of the disease. The appearance of oral lesions without skin lesions is highly improbable. The differential diagnosis includes late-stage syphilis, sarcoidosis, cutaneous leish- maniasis, lupus erythematosus, lymphoma, and neoplastic disease. A biopsy must be performed to confirm the diagno- sis because no laboratory test for leprosy exists.
Treatment
Current treatment centers on a chemotherapeutic approach in which several drugs are used over a protracted period, typically years. The drugs most commonly used include dapsone, ri- fampin, clofazimine, and minocycline. The known teratogen thalidomide is useful for managing the complications of lep- rosy therapy, as are thalidomide analogs (e.g., lenalidomide) by virtue of their general immunomodulatory properties.
Actinomycosis
Etiology and Pathogenesis
Actinomycosis is a chronic bacterial disease that, as the name suggests, exhibits some clinical and microscopic features that are fungus-like. It is most commonly caused by Actinomyces israelii, an anaerobic or microaerophilic, gram-positive bacterium. On rare occasions, other Actino- myces species may be involved, or the gram-positive an- aerobic bacillus propionibacterium propionicus will result in a similar clinical diagnosis. A. israelii is a normal inhab- itant of the oral cavity in a majority of healthy individuals. It is usually found in tonsillar crypts, gingival crevices, carious lesions, and nonvital dental root canals. Actinomy- cosis is not regarded as a contagious disease because infec- tion cannot be transmitted from one individual to an- other. Infection usually appears after trauma, surgery, or previous infection. Tooth extraction, gingival surgery, and oral infection predispose to the development of this con- dition. Evidence of other important predisposing factors has been slight, although actinomycotic infections have been recorded in osteoradionecrosis and bisphosphonate- related osteonecrosis of the jaw, and in patients with serious systemic illness.
Clinical Features
Most infections from A. israelii are seen in the thorax, abdo- men, and head and neck; they are usually preceded by trauma or direct extension of a contiguous infection. When it occurs in the head and neck, the condition is usually designated cervicofacial actinomycosis (Figure 2-20). It typically presents as swelling of the mandible that may simulate a pyogenic infection. The lesion may become in- durated and eventually may form one or more draining si- nuses, leading from the medullary spaces of the mandible to the skin of the neck. The clinical course ranges from acute to chronic. The skin lesions are indurated and are described as having a “woody hard” consistency. Any mucosal site may be involved; bony sites are also commonly infected. Less commonly, the maxilla may be involved, resulting in an
• Figure 2-20 Cervicofacial actinomycosis. (Reproduced with per- mission from Regezi JA, Sciubba JJ, Pogrel MA: Atlas of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology. Philadelphia, 2000, WB Saunders, Fig. 10-15.)
osteomyelitis that may drain through the gingiva via a sinus tract. Pus draining from the chronic lesion may contain small yellow granules, known as sulfur granules, which represent ag- gregates of A. israelii organisms. Radiographically, this infection presents as a lucency with irregular and ill-defined margins.
Histopathology
A granulomatous inflammatory response with central abscess formation is seen in actinomycosis (Figures 2-21 and 2-22). At the center of the abscesses, distinctive colonies of gram- positive organisms may be seen. Radiating from the center of the colonies are numerous filaments with clubbed ends.
Differential Diagnosis
Clinically, actinomycosis may have to be differentiated from osteomyelitis caused by other bacterial or fungal organisms. Infection of the soft tissue of the neck, such as scrofula, and staphylococcal infection, such as botryomycosis, may also be considered.
Definitive diagnosis is dependent on identification of the actinomycotic organism. This may be done through direct examination of exudate, microscopic evaluation of tissue sections, or microbiologic culture of pathologic material.
• Figure 2-21 Actinomycosis colony (sulfur granule) surrounded by pus.

 • Figure 2-22 Actinomycosis. Gram stain of colony showing periph- eral gram-positive filaments.
Treatment
Long-term, high-dose penicillin, or penicillin analogs is the required antibiotic regimen for actinomycosis. In se- vere cases, intravenous penicillin followed by prolonged oral penicillin administration from several months to up to a year in deep, chronic disease is a standard regimen. Less severe cases require protracted courses of oral penicillin. Tetracycline and erythromycin are also effective cures. In addition, drainage of abscesses, debridement, and surgical excision of scar and sinus tracts are recommended to aerate tissue and to enhance penetration of antibiotics.
Noma
Noma, also known as cancrum oris and gangrenous stoma- titis, is a devastating disease of malnourished children that is characterized by a destructive process of the orofacial tis- sues. The condition is rare in developed countries but is a relatively common cause of childhood mortality and mor- bidity in parts of Africa, South America, and Asia.
Etiology and Pathogenesis
Necrosis of tissue occurs as a consequence of invasion by an- aerobic bacteria in a host whose systemic health is significantly compromised. It has been proposed that noma results from oral contamination by a heavy infestation of Fusobacterium necrophorum, and a consortium of other microorganisms, in- cluding Prevotella intermedia, Borrelia vincentii, Treponema denticola, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. These opportunistic pathogens invade oral tissues whose de- fenses are weakened by malnutrition, acute necrotizing gingi- vitis, debilitating conditions, trauma, and other oral mucosal ulcers. Other predisposing factors include debilitation caused by systemic disease, such as pneumonia or sepsis.
Clinical Features
Noma typically affects children. A related disorder, noma neo- natorum, occurs in low-birth-weight infants who suffer from other debilitating diseases. The initial lesion of noma is a pain- ful ulceration, usually of the gingiva or buccal mucosa, which spreads rapidly and eventually becomes necrotic. Denudation
of involved bone may follow, eventually leading to necrosis and sequestration. Teeth in the affected area may become loose and exfoliate. Penetration of organisms into the cheek, lip, or palate may also occur, resulting in fetid necrotic lesions.
Treatment
Therapy involves treating the underlying predisposing con- dition, as well as the infection itself. Therefore fluids, elec- trolytes, and general nutrition are restored, along with the introduction of antibiotics. Antibiotics of choice include clindamycin, piperacillin, and the aminoglycoside gentami- cin. Debridement of necrotic tissue may be beneficial if destruction is extensive, with reconstructive surgery a late option following acute management and healing.
Fungal Infections
Deep Fungal Infections
Etiology and Pathogenesis
Deep fungal infections are characterized by primary in- volvement of the lungs. Infections may disseminate from this focus to involve other organs.
Deep fungal infections having a significant incidence of oral involvement include histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis, mucormycosis, and cryptococcosis (Box 2-5; Table 2-1). Oral infections typically follow implantation of infected sputum in oral mucosa. Oral infections may also follow hematogenous spread of fungus from another site such as the lung, and may present as the initial sign of the disease.
Histoplasmosis, a dimorphic saprophytic fungus found in the soil contaminated with bird or bat feces, has a world- wide distribution, although it is endemic in the midwestern United States. Inhalation of yeast from the dust of dried pigeon or bat droppings is regarded as the most common source of infection. Coccidioidomycosis is a dipmorphic fungus that is endemic in the Western United States, espe- cially in the San Joaquin Valley of California, where it is

A skin eruption resembling erythema multiforme occasionally appears concomitantly with coccidioidomycosis infection (Box 2-6; Figure 2-23).
Oral lesions are usually preceded by pulmonary infec- tion. Primary involvement of oral mucous membranes is a highly unlikely route of infection. Swallowed infected

sputum may cause oral or gastrointestinal lesions. Also, ero- sion into pulmonary blood vessels by the inflammatory process may result in hematogenous spread to almost any organ. The usual oral lesion is ulcerative. Whether single or multiple, lesions are nonhealing, indurated, and frequently painful. Purulence may be an additional feature of blasto- mycotic lesions.
Histopathology
The basic inflammatory response in a deep fungal infection is granulomatous. In the presence of these microorganisms, macrophages and multinucleated giant cells dominate the histologic picture (Figures 2-24 and 2-25). Purulence may be a feature of blastomycosis and, less likely, of coccidioido- mycosis and cryptococcosis. Peculiar to blastomycosis is pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, associated with superfi- cial infection in which ulceration has not yet occurred.

 • Figure 2-24 Histoplasmosis showing macrophages with cyto- plasmic microorganisms.
• Figure 2-25 Blastomycosis showing granuloma (macrophages) with a central abscess.
Differential Diagnosis
Clinically, the chronic, nonhealing oral ulcers caused by deep fungal infection may resemble those of oral squamous cell carcinoma, chronic trauma, oral TB, and primary syphilis. Blastomycosis may produce a clinical picture that simulates cervicofacial actinomycosis. Culture of organ- isms from lesions or microscopic identification of organ- isms in biopsy tissue is required to establish a definitive diagnosis.
Treatment
Treatment of deep mycotic infection generally consists of antimicrobials such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, and amphotericin B. Both ketoconazole and fluconazole can be administered orally. Amphotericin B is highly toxic, particularly to the kidneys, and side effects are relatively common. In immunocompromised transplant recipients or in debilitated patients, more aggressive medical man- agement with newer agents such as echinocandins, posaconazole, and voriconazole may be necessary. Surgi- cal resection or incision and drainage may be used occa- sionally to enhance drug effects in treating some necrotic lung infections.
Subcutaneous Fungal Infection: Sporotrichosis
Etiology and Pathogenesis
Some fungal infections affect primarily subcutaneous tissues. One of these, sporotrichosis (Rose gardener’s disease), is sig- nificant because it is a widely distributed worldwide infection that may have oral manifestations. It is caused by Sporothrix schenckii and results from inoculation of the skin or mucosa by contaminated soil or thorny plants such as roses. After an incubation period of several weeks, subcutaneous nodules, which frequently become ulcerated, develop. Systemic in- volvement is rare but may occur in individuals with defective or suppressed immune responses.
Clinical Features
Lesions appear at the site of inoculation and spread along lymphatic channels. On the skin, red nodules appear, with subsequent breakdown, exudate production, and ulcer- ation. Orally, lesions typically present as nonspecific chronic ulcers. Lymphadenopathy may also be present.
Histopathology
The inflammatory response to S. schenckii is granulomatous. Central abscesses may be found in some of the granulomas, and overlying epithelium may exhibit pseudoepithelioma- tous hyperplasia. The relatively small, round to oval fungus may be seen in tissue sections.
Diagnosis
Sporotrichosis is difficult to diagnose since it resembles several other diseases and serological testing for antibodies to S. schenckii is generally unreliable. Definitive diagnosis is based on culture of infected tissue on Sabouraud agar. Spe- cial silver stains may also be used to identify the organism in tissue biopsy specimens.
Treatment
Sporotrichosis usually is treated with a solution of saturated potassium iodide and, less commonly, with systemic antifungal agents. In cases of toxicity or allergy to iodides, ketoconazole has been used with limited success. Generally, patients respond well to treatment, with little morbidity.
Opportunistic Fungal Infections: Mucormycosis (Phycomycosis) and Aspergillosis
Etiology and Pathogenesis
Zygomycosis is a broad term that refers to infections caused by several bread mold fungi of the zygomycota group. In the head and neck, mucormycosis is the fungal sinonasal infection that is caused by species in the Mucor, Rhizopus and Absidia groups. Aspergillus is ubiquitous in the envi- ronment. Infection typically occurs in patients with poorly controlled ketoacidotic diabetes, immunosuppressed trans- plant recipients, patients with advanced malignancies, pa- tients being treated with steroids or radiation, and those who are immunosuppressed for any other reason, including HIV infection and AIDS.

38 CHAPTER 2
Ulcerative Conditions
The route of infection passes through the gastrointestinal tract or the respiratory tract, and infection may occur any- where along these routes.
Clinical Features
In the head and neck, lesions are most likely to occur in the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, and possibly the oropharynx. Pain and swelling precede ulceration. Tissue necrosis may result in perfora- tion of the palate. Extension into the orbit or brain is a common complication. The fungus has a propensity for arterial wall inva- sion, which may lead to hematogenous spread, thrombosis, or infarction. Rarely, a periodontal presentation may be noted, usu- ally associated with a preexisting medical condition, in particular those conditions where immunosuppression is present.
Histopathology
Microscopically, an acute and chronic inflammatory infil- trate is seen in response to the fungus (Figure 2-26). The organism is usually and readily identified in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections in areas of tissue necrosis. Characteristic necrotic vessel walls containing thrombi and fungi may be evident. Microscopically, the fungus consists of large, pale-staining, nonseptate hyphae that tend to branch at right angles. Mucormycosis is characterized by the presence of wide, flat nonseptate fungal organisms.
Differential Diagnosis
It is important for clinicians to recognize that several opportu- nistic fungal infections can arise in the nasal and paranasal si- nuses of an immunocompromised host. Confirmation must be made by identification of the fungus in biopsy tissue, exudate, or culture. Because of the severity of the underlying disease and the often-rapid course that this infection may take, diagnosis of mucormycosis may not be made until after death.
Perforating palatal lesions are generally rare, but may be seen in association with other diseases such as gummatous necrosis of tertiary syphilis, midline granuloma (NK/T-cell lymphoma), and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (We- gener’s granulomatosis). Rarely, malignancies of nasal and sinus origin (squamous cell carcinoma and salivary gland
• Figure 2-26 Silver stain of Aspergillus in a tissue section with green counterstain.
adenocarcinoma) may present through the palate. A biopsy is required to differentiate these lesions.
Treatment
Lipid-based formulations of amphotericin B are the drugs of choice for the treatment of phycomycosis and aspergillosis. Surgical debridement of upper respiratory tract lesions is often required. The prognosis is generally dependent on the severity of underlying disease and the institution of appropriate ther- apy. In selected patients, adjunctive treatment with hyperbaric oxygen, recombinant cytokines, and/or granulocyte transfu- sions may be considered. Death is a relatively frequent conse- quence of this infection. Generally, lung infections are more likely to be lethal than upper respiratory tract infections.
Immunologic Diseases
Aphthous Ulcers
Of all the types of nontraumatic ulceration that affect oral mucosa, aphthous ulcers (canker sores) are probably the most common. The incidence ranges from 20% to 60%, depending on the population studied. Prevalence tends to be higher in professional, or white collar, individuals, upper socioeconomic groups, and nonsmokers.
Etiology
Although the cause of aphthous ulcerations is unknown, several possibilities have been postulated (Box 2-7).
There is considerable evidence that aphthous ulcers are re- lated to a focal immune dysfunction in which T lymphocytes have a significant role. The nature of the initiating stimulus remains a mystery. The causative agent could be endogenous (autoimmune) antigen or exogenous (hyperimmune) antigen, or it could be a nonspecific factor, such as trauma in which chemical mediators may be involved. Neurogenic inflamma- tion could result from an initiating stimulus. Focal release of a neuropeptide, such as substance P, could mediate lymphocytic infiltration and epithelial necrosis, generating an aphthous

ulcer. Focal release of cytokines may delay healing, which typi- fies the clinical course of these lesions.
Because of the clinical similarity of oral aphthous ulcers to secondary herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection (Table 2-2), a viral cause has been investigated extensively, but this has not been substantiated. Hypersensitivity to bacterial antigens of Streptococcus sanguis has been suggested, but this theory has also not been proven, although cross-reactivity associated with microbial antigens and similarly structured oral epithe- lial peptides may be possible.
Deficiencies of vitamin B12, folic acid, and iron as measured in serum have been found in only a small percentage of pa- tients with aphthous ulcers. Correction of these deficiencies has produced improvement or cure in this small group. Pa- tients with malabsorption conditions such as celiac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy or nontropical sprue) and Crohn’s
Aphthous Ulcers vs. Secondary Herpes Simple Infection
disease have been reported as having occasional aphthous-type ulcers, with the latter disease possibly related to an autoinflam- matory process. In such cases, deficiencies of folic acid and factors related to underlying disease may be part of the cause.
Other causes of aphthous ulcers that have been investigated include hormonal alterations, stress, trauma, and food allergies to substances in nuts, chocolate, and gluten. Additionally, out- breaks have been stated to result from exposure to certain preservatives and toothpaste components. None of these is seri- ously regarded as being important in the primary causation of aphthous ulcers, although any of them may have a modifying or triggering role. Although HIV-positive patients may have more severe and protracted aphthous-like ulcers, the possible etiologic role of HIV and other agents is unknown.
Family history represents a risk factor. Over 40% of af- fected patients have a first-degree relative who is also affected by aphthous ulcers. A 90% degree of risk is present when both parents are affected. The role of HLA- B51 antigen may be an important factor in aphthous ulcer susceptibility.
Clinical Features
Three forms of aphthous ulcers have been recognized: minor, major, and herpetiform aphthous ulcers (Table 2-3). All are believed to be part of the same disease spectrum, and all are believed to have a common etiology. Differences are essentially clinical and correspond to the degree of severity. All forms present as painful recurrent ulcers. Patients occa- sionally have prodromal symptoms of tingling or burning before the appearance of lesions. The ulcers are not preceded by vesicles and characteristically appear on the vestibular and buccal mucosa, tongue, soft palate, fauces, and floor of the mouth. Only rarely do these lesions occur on the attached gingiva and hard palate, thus providing an important clinical sign for the separation of aphthous ulcers from secondary herpetic ulcers. In patients with AIDS, however, aphthous- like ulcers may occur at any mucosal site.
Minor Aphthous Ulcers
Minor aphthous ulcers are the most commonly encoun- tered form. This type usually appears as a single, painful, oval ulcer that is less than 0.5 cm in diameter, covered by a yellow fibrinous membrane and surrounded by an ery- thematous halo (Figures 2-27 and 2-28). Multiple oral

aphthae may be seen. When the lateral or ventral surfaces of the tongue are affected, pain tends to be out of proportion to the size of the lesion (Figure 2-29). Minor aphthous ulcers generally last 7 to 10 days and heal without scar for- mation. Recurrences vary from one individual to another. Periods of freedom from disease may range from a matter of weeks to as long as years.
In some patients with recalcitrant aphthae, a diagnosis of Crohn’s disease may be considered. This granulomatous
disease may affect the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus. Oral manifestations include mucosal fissures and small, multiple, hyperplastic nodules on the buccal mu- cosa, producing a cobblestone appearance (Figures 2-30 and 2-31). Biopsy findings of these mucosal nodules show small, noncaseating granulomas characteristic of Crohn’s disease. HIV-positive patients may develop minor aph- thous ulcers, although proportionately more have major or herpetiform lesions. Aphthous-like ulcerations may be seen as an initial manifestation of the periodic fever syn- dromes; rare noninfectious disorders are related to genetic disturbances in the mechanisms/proteins that control inflammation.
Major Aphthous Ulcers
Major aphthous ulcers were previously thought to be a separate entity, and this form was referred to as periadenitis mucosa necrotica recurrens or Sutton’s disease. It is now regarded as the most severe expression of aphthous stomati- tis. Lesions are larger (.0.5 cm) and more painful and persist longer than minor aphthae (Figure 2-32). Because of the depth of inflammation, major aphthous ulcers clinically appear crateriform and heal with scar formation. Lesions may take as long as 6 weeks to heal, and as soon as one ulcer disappears, another one starts. In patients who experience an unremitting course with significant pain and discomfort, systemic health may be compromised because of difficulty in eating and psychological stress. The predilection for mov- able oral mucosa is as typical for major aphthous ulcers as it is for minor aphthae. HIV-positive patients may have aph- thous lesions at any intraoral site.
Herpetiform Aphthous Ulcers
Herpetiform aphthous ulcers present clinically as recurrent crops of small ulcers (Figures 2-33 and 2-34). Although movable mucosa is predominantly affected, palatal and gingival mucosa may also be involved. Pain may be consid- erable, and healing generally occurs in 1 to 2 weeks. Unlike herpes infection, herpetiform aphthous ulcers are not pre- ceded by vesicles and exhibit no virus-infected cells. Other than the clinical feature of crops of oral ulcers, no finding can link this disease to a viral infection.
Histopathology
Because the diagnosis of these ulcers is usually evident clinically, biopsies usually are unnecessary and therefore are rarely performed. Aphthous ulcers have nonspecific micro- scopic findings, and no histologic features are diagnostic (Figures 2-35 and 2-36). At no time are virus-infected cells evident. Essentially, the same microscopic changes are found in all forms of aphthous ulcers. Studies have shown that mononuclear cells are found in submucosa and peri- vascular tissues in the preulcerative stage. These cells are predominantly CD4 lymphocytes, which soon are out- numbered by CD8 lymphocytes as the ulcerative stage develops. Macrophages and mast cells are common inhab- itants of the ulcer.

• Figure 2-36 Aphthous ulcer showing nonspecific changes. Treatment
In patients with occasional or few minor aphthous ulcers, usually no treatment is needed apart from a bland mouth rinse such as sodium bicarbonate in warm water to keep the mouth clean. However, when patients are more severely af- fected, some forms of treatment can provide significant
control (but not necessarily a cure) of this disease. Immu- nomodulation using corticosteroids, either topical or sys- temically administered, has been used to manage the disease, but does not necessarily prevent future recurrence. In severely affected patients, systemic steroids may be used for immediate control. A low to moderate dose of prednisone for a short period is effective. A typical regimen might be 20 to 40 mg daily for 1 week, followed by another week at half the initial dose. However, for patients with mild to moderate disease, only topical therapy appears justified. Topical steroids, if used judiciously, can be relatively effica- cious and safe (see section on treatment of pemphigus vul- garis for corticosteroid effects and side effects). Although many topical compounds have been developed for use on the skin, it has been standard practice to prescribe these agents for use on mucous membranes (Box 2-8). Intrale- sional injection of triamcinolone may be used for individual or focal problematic lesions. In cases where repeated ulcer- ative episodes occur and use of systemic steroids is not possible and topical agents are not effective, systemic mon- telukast (a leukotriene receptor antagonist) administration may be useful.
Antibiotics. Antibioticshavebeenusedinthetreatment of aphthous ulcers with fair to good results. Tetracycline or doxycycline suspensions, used topically, often produce ex- cellent results. In addition to their antibacterial effect of keeping the mouth clean, tetracyclines speed resolution of the ulcers through local inhibition of matrix metallopro- teinases (MMPs). Because tetracyclines readily break down in solution or when exposed to light, they must be used within a very short time span. A typical regimen for treating aphthous ulcers consists of emptying a 250-mg capsule of tetracycline into 30 mL (1 fluid ounce) of warm water and then rinsing the mouth for several minutes. This is repeated up to 4 times a day for 4 days. Results are best if this mouth rinse is used on the first day that the ulcers appear, or when they are in a prodromal stage.
Other Drugs. Because of their rather profound side ef- fects, immunosuppressive drugs, such as azathioprine and cyclophosphamide, are generally justified only for the treat- ment of severely affected patients (to permit reduced pred- nisone dosages). Recent studies indicate thalidomide may provide relief to severely affected patients, especially AIDS patients. Two other drugs that have shown some therapeu- tic efficacy are pentoxifylline and colchicine.

This is a rare debilitating mucocutaneous disorder that pro- duces desquamation and ulceration of the oral mucosa. Clinically, it may resemble several other mucocutaneous conditions, including hypersensitivity reaction, lichen pla- nus, mucous membrane pemphigoid, linear immunoglobu- lin (Ig)A disease, and pemphigus vulgaris. The condition most commonly presents in older white women, typically on the tongue, buccal mucosa, or gingiva. Biopsy findings on H&E-stained sections can be nonspecific or may resem- ble lichen planus. Direct immunofluorescence examination shows perinuclear deposits of IgG in the basal and lower one-third epithelial layers (Figure 2-37), but with an absence of staining for other immunoglobulin types or fibrinogen. Tissue and circulating autoantibodies to the DNp63a pro- tein have been associated with chronic ulcerative stomatitis, but their role in its etiology and pathogenesis remains unproven. In contrast to other immune-mediated mucocu- taneous diseases, chronic ulcerative stomatitis has been reported to respond less effectively to corticosteroids but shows a good response to hydroxychloroquine. This condition has no relation to gastrointestinal or other auto- immune diseases, nor have systemic manifestations or malig- nant transformation been noted.
Behçet’s Syndrome
Behçet’s syndrome is a rare multisystem inflammatory dis- ease (gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, ocular, CNS, articular, pulmonary, or dermal) in which recurrent oral aphthae is a consistent feature. Although the oral manifestations are usually relatively minor, involvement of other sites, espe- cially the eyes and CNS, can be serious.
Etiology
The cause of this noninfectious condition in which vasculi- tis is a primary feature is poorly understood, although it seems to be related to an immune dysfunction or to an ab- normality within the innate immune system. Behçet’s syn- drome may have a genetic predisposition as well and a geographic prevalence (especially Turkey and other Eastern
quent presence of human leukocyte antigen HLA-B51.
Clinical Features
Lesions of Behçet’s syndrome typically affect the oral cavity (100% incidence), the genitalia (62% of cases), and the eyes (Box 2-9; Figures 2-38 and 2-39). Other regions or systems are less commonly involved. Recurrent arthritis of the wrists, ankles, and knees may be associated. Cardiovascular

manifestations are believed to result from vasculitis and thrombosis. CNS manifestations are frequently seen in the form of headaches, although infarcts have been reported. Pustular erythema nodosum–like skin lesions have been described. Relapsing polychondritis (e.g., auricular carti- lage, nasal cartilage) in association with Behçet’s stigmata has been designated as the MAGIC syndrome (mouth and genital ulcers with inflamed cartilage).
Oral manifestations of this syndrome appear identical to the ulcers of aphthous stomatitis. The ulcers are usually the minor aphthous form and are found in the typical aphthous distribution.
Ocular changes are noted in most patients with Behçet’s syndrome. Uveitis, conjunctivitis, and retinitis are among the more common inflammatory processes.
Genital lesions are ulcerative in nature and may cause significant pain and discomfort. Painful ulcerative lesions may occur around the anus. Inflammatory bowel disease and neurologic problems have been described in some patients.
Histopathology
T lymphocytes are prominent in the ulcerative lesions of Behçet’s syndrome. However, neutrophilic infiltrates in which the cells appear within vessel walls (vasculitis) have been described. Immunopathologic support of a vascular target in this condition comes from the demonstration of immunoglobulins and complement within the vessel walls.
Diagnosis
The diagnosis of Behçet’s syndrome is based on clinical signs and symptoms associated with the various regions af- fected. No specific findings are noted in biopsy tissue, and no supportive laboratory tests are available.
Treatment
No standard therapy is known for Behçet’s syndrome. Systemic corticosteroids are often prescribed, and other immunosuppressive drugs, such as chlorambucil and aza- thioprine, may be used instead of or in addition to ste- roids. Dapsone, cyclosporine, thalidomide, interferon,
and biological anti–tumor necrosis factor (anti–TNF) agents may play a role in the treatment of these patients, depending on the degree of disease severity.
Reiter’s Syndrome
Etiology
Classically, Reiter’s syndrome or Reiter’s disease, a form of reactive arthritis, is a clinical tetrad of nonspecific urethritis, conjunctivitis, mucocutaneous lesions, and arthritis that follows bacterial dysentery (Shigella, Yersinia, Salmonella, Clostridium, and Campylobacter organisms) or exposure to a sexually transmissible disease, in particular, Chlamydia trachomatis. An abnormal immune response to microbial antigen(s) is now regarded as a likely mechanism for the multiple manifestations of this syndrome. A male with HLA-B27 has a 20% risk for Reiter’s disease after an episode of Shigella dysentery.
Clinical Features
The onset of Reiter’s syndrome is acute, with the simultane- ous appearance of urethritis, conjunctivitis, and oligoarthri- tis affecting large and small joints of the lower limbs. This usually occurs 1 to 3 weeks after a sexual episode or follow- ing an attack of dysentery. Other features include fever, weight loss, vasomotor abnormalities in the feet, and skin lesions consisting of faint macules, vesicles, and pustules on the hands and feet. Bilateral conjunctivitis occurs and, in 10% of cases, acute iritis is seen. The arthritis is self-limiting, and remission occurs in 2 to 3 months.
Oral lesions have been described in up to 17% of cases as relatively painless aphthous-type ulcers occurring almost anywhere in the mouth. Tongue lesions resemble geo- graphic tongue.
Highly characteristic of this syndrome is its occurrence predominantly in white men in their third decade. The duration of the disease varies from weeks to months, and recurrences are not uncommon.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis is dependent on recognition of the various signs and symptoms associated with this syndrome. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is elevated in the acute phase of the disease but persists after arthritis resolves. By tissue typing, more than 70% of patients will have the HLA-B27 genotype.
Treatment
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are gener- ally used in the treatment of this disease. Antibiotics have been added to the treatment regimen, with varied success. Systemic corticosteroids are rarely required.
Erythema Multiforme
Erythema multiforme (EM) is an acute self-limiting hyper- sensitivity reaction characterized by target skin lesions and/or ulcerative oral lesions. It has been divided into two subtypes: a minor form, usually associated with an HSV trigger, and a major severe form, triggered by certain systemic drugs.
 
www.konkur.in
Etiology and Pathogenesis
The basic cause of EM is unknown, although a hypersensi- tivity reaction is suspected. Some evidence suggests that the disease mechanism may be related to antigen-antibody complexes that are targeted for small vessels in the skin or mucosa. In about half of cases, precipitating or triggering factors can be identified. These generally fall into the two large categories of infections and drugs. Other factors, such as malignancy, vaccination, autoimmune disease, and radio- therapy, are occasionally cited as possible triggers. Infections frequently reported include HSV infection (due to HSV types 1 and 2), TB, and histoplasmosis. In cases of recurrent idiopathic forms of this disease, HSV DNA can be detected by use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis in 50% of cases. Various types of drugs have precipitated EM, with barbiturates, sulfonamides, and some anti-seizure medica- tions such as carbamazepine and phenytoin being among the more frequent offenders. Although these drugs are phar- macologically unrelated, the mechanism by which EM is precipitated is related to similar protein folds that expose regions that are antigenically similar.
Clinical Features
EM is usually an acute, self-limited process that affects the skin or mucous membranes or both (Box 2-10). Between

25% and 50% of patients with cutaneous EM have oral manifestations of this disease (Figures 2-40 and 2-41). It may on occasion be chronic, or it may be a recurring acute problem. In recurrent disease, prodromal symptoms may be experienced before any eruption. Young adults are most commonly affected. Individuals often develop EM in the spring or fall and may have such recrudescences chronically. The term erythema multiforme was coined to indicate the multiple and varied clinical appearances that are associated with cutaneous manifestations of this disease. The classic skin lesion of EM is the target or iris lesion. It consists of concentric erythematous rings separated by rings of near- normal color. Typically, the extremities are involved, usually in a symmetric distribution (Figure 2-42). Other types of skin manifestations of EM include macules, papules, vesicles, bullae, and urticarial plaques.
Within the mouth, EM characteristically presents as an ulcerative disease, varying from a few aphthous-type lesions to multiple superficial, widespread ulcers in EM major. Short-lived vesicles or bullae are infrequently seen at initial presentation. Any area of the mouth may be involved, with the lips, buccal mucosa, palate, and tongue being most frequently affected. Recurrent oral lesions may appear as multiple painful ulcers similar to those of the initial episode or as less symptomatic erythematous patches with limited ulceration.
Symptoms range from mild discomfort to severe pain. Considerable apprehension may be associated with this condition initially because of occasional explosive onset in some patients. Systemic signs and symptoms of headache, slightly elevated temperature, and lymphadenopathy may accompany more intense disease.
At the severe end of the EM spectrum (EM major), in- tense involvement of the mouth, eyes (Figure 2-43), skin, genitalia, and occasionally the esophagus and respiratory tract may be seen concurrently. This form of EM major, sometimes called Stevens-Johnson syndrome, has a strong relation to medications, in particular analgesics, where oxicams or propionic acid derivatives have been used. Characteristically, the lips show crusting ulceration at the vermilion border that may cause exquisite pain. Superficial

ulceration, often preceded by bullae, is common to all sites affected. Ocular inflammation (conjunctivitis and uveitis) may lead to scarring and blindness.
Histopathology
The microscopic pattern of EM varies but consists of epithe- lial hyperplasia and spongiosis (Figure 2-44). Basal and parabasal apoptotic keratinocytes are usually seen. Vesicles occur at the epithelium–connective tissue interface, al- though intraepithelial vesiculation may be seen. Epithelial necrosis is a frequent finding. Connective tissue changes usually appear as infiltrates of lymphocytes and macrophages in perivascular spaces and in connective tissue papillae.
Immunopathologic studies are nonspecific for EM. The epithelium shows negative staining for immunoglobulins. Vessels have been shown, however, to have IgM, comple- ment, and fibrin deposits in their walls. This latter finding has been used to support an immune complex vasculitis cause for EM. Autoantibodies to desmoplakins 1 and 2 have been identified in a subset of EM major–affected patients, suggesting that both cell-mediated and humoral immune systems may contribute to the pathogenesis of EM.
Differential Diagnosis
When target, or iris, skin lesions are present, clinical diag- nosis is usually straightforward. However, in the absence of these or any skin lesions, several possibilities should be con- sidered for oral expression of this disease, including primary HSV infections (Table 2-4), aphthous ulcers, pemphigus vulgaris, mucous membrane pemphigoid, paraneoplastic pemphigus, and erosive lichen planus. The general lack of systemic symptoms; the favored oral location of the lips, buccal mucosa, tongue, and palate (rarely gingiva); the larger ulcers (usually not preceded by blisters); the presence of target skin lesions; and a history of recent drug ingestion or infection should favor a diagnosis of EM.
Treatment
In EM minor, symptomatic treatment, including keeping the mouth clean with bland mouth rinses, may be all that is

   necessary. In EM major, topical corticosteroids with antifun- gals may help control disease. The use of systemic corticoste- roids remains controversial and is believed by some to be contraindicated, particularly as maintenance therapy. Acy- clovir at 400 to 600 mg daily may be effective in preventing recurrences in patients who have an HSV-triggered disease, although the efficacy is not clear. Supportive measures, such as oral irrigation, adequate fluid intake, and use of antipyret- ics, may provide patients with substantial benefit.
Drug Reactions
Etiology and Pathogenesis
Although the skin is more commonly involved in adverse reactions to drugs, the oral mucosa may occasionally be the target. Virtually any drug has the potential to cause an un- toward reaction, but some have a greater ability to do so than others. Also, some patients have a greater tendency than others to react to drugs. Some of the drugs that are more commonly cited as being involved in adverse reactions

 are listed in Box 2-11. The totality of drugs capable of or reported to be associated with oral mucosal side effects (sto- matitis medicamentosa) is very extensive, with a range of manifestations including blistering, lichen planus–like (lichenoid) and lupus-like reactions, ulcerative lesions, and fixed (edema, erythema) eruptions. Careful review of a patient’s drug profile in the face of oral mucosal altera- tions is crucial in establishing or ruling out an allergic or hypersensitivity-based etiology.
The pathogenesis of drug reactions may be related to im- munologic or nonimmunologic mechanisms (Box 2-12). Immunologic mechanisms are triggered by an antigenic component (hapten) on the drug molecule, resulting in a hyperimmune response, or drug allergy. The potential for drug allergy is directly dependent on the immunogenicity

of the drug, the frequency of exposure, the route of admin- istration (topical more likely than oral), and the innate reactivity of the patient’s immune system. Mechanisms in- volved in drug allergy include IgE-mediated reactions, cyto- toxic reactions (antibody binds to a drug that is already at- tached to a cell surface), and circulation of antigen (drug)-antibody complexes.
Drug reactions that are nonimmunologic in nature do not stimulate an immune response and are not antibody depen- dent. In this type of response, drugs may directly affect mast cells, causing the release of chemical mediators. Reactions may result from overdose, toxicity, or side effects of the drugs.
Clinical Features
Cutaneous manifestations of drug reactions are widely varied. Changes may appear rapidly, as in anaphylaxis, angioedema, and urticaria, or after several days of drug use. Manifestations include urticaria, maculopapular rash, erythema, vesicles, ulcers, and target lesions (EM) (Figures 2-45 to 2-48).
Acquired angioedema is an IgE-mediated allergic reaction that is precipitated by drugs or foods such as nuts and shell- fish. These substances may act as sensitizing agents (anti- gens) that elicit IgE production. On antigenic rechallenge, mast cells bound with IgE in the skin or mucosa release their contents to cause the clinical picture of angioedema. Hereditary angioedema produces similar clinical changes

but through a different mechanism. Individuals who inherit this rare autosomal-dominant trait develop a spontaneous mutation, which results in a deficiency of the inhibitor of the first component of complement C1 esterase. Absent or dysfunctional C1 esterase inhibitor ultimately leads to re- lease of vasoactive peptides and the often serious clinical manifestations that characterize this condition.
Angioedema, by an acquired or a hereditary pathway, ap- pears as a soft, diffuse, painless swelling, usually of the lips, neck, or face. There is typically no color change. The condition

generally subsides after 1 to 2 days and may recur at a later date. It is a curious note that minor trauma can also precipitate the swelling. Emergency treatment may be required if the pro- cess leads to respiratory distress because of glottic or laryngeal involvement. Antihistamines and, in problematic cases, corti- costeroids are used to treat this form of allergy.
Oral manifestations of drug reactions may be erythema- tous, vesicular, or ulcerative. They may also mimic erosive lichen planus, in which case they are known as lichenoid drug reactions (Box 2-13). The widespread ulcers typical of EM are often representative of a drug reaction.
Histopathology
The microscopy of drug reactions includes such nonspecific features as spongiosis, apoptotic keratinocytes, lymphoid infiltrates, eosinophils, and ulceration. An interface pattern of mucositis (i.e., a lymphoid infiltrate focused at the epi- thelium–connective tissue interface) is often seen in muco- sal allergic reactions and can resemble the changes seen in lichen planus. Although biopsy findings may not be diag- nostic, they may be helpful in ruling out other diagnostic considerations.
Diagnosis
Because the clinical and histologic features of drug reactions are highly variable and nonspecific, the diagnosis of drug reaction requires a high index of suspicion and careful his- tory taking. Recent use of a drug is important, although delayed reaction (up to 2 weeks) may occasionally be noted (e.g., with ampicillin). Withdrawal of the suspected drug should result in improvement, and reinstitution of the drug (a procedure that is usually ill advised for the patient’s safety)
should exacerbate the patient’s condition. If rechallenge is performed, minute amounts of the offending drug or a structurally related drug should cause a reaction.
Treatment
The most important measures in the management of drug reactions are identification and withdrawal of the causative agent. If this is impossible or undesirable, alternative drugs may have to be substituted, or the eruption may have to be dealt with on an empirical basis. Antihistamines and occa- sionally corticosteroids may be useful in the management of oral and cutaneous eruptions caused by drug reactions.
Contact Allergies
Etiology and Pathogenesis
Contact allergic reactions (stomatitis venenata) can be caused by antigenic stimulation by a vast array of foreign substances, including foods and flavoring agents, preserva- tives, oral care products, dental materials, and many other agents. The generated immune response is predominantly T-cell mediated. In the sensitization phase, epithelial Lang- erhans cells appear to have a major role in the recognition of foreign antigen. These dendritic cells are responsible for processing antigens that enter the epithelium from the ex- ternal environment. The Langerhans cells subsequently present the appropriate antigenic determinants to T lym- phocytes. After antigenic rechallenge, local lymphocytes secrete chemical mediators of inflammation (cytokines) that produce the clinical and histologic changes characteristic of this process.
Clinical Features
Lesions of contact allergy occur directly adjacent to the placement or location of the causative agent. Presentation is varied and includes erythematous, erosive, vesicular, lichen- oid, and ulcerative lesions (Figures 2-49 and 2-50).
Although contact allergy is frequently seen on the skin, it is relatively uncommon intraorally. Some of the many mate- rials containing agents known to cause oral contact allergic reactions are toothpaste, mouthwash, candy, chewing gum, topical antimicrobials, topical steroids, iodine, essential oils, and denture base material.

identified as an etiologic agent in oral contact stomatitis. Lesions associated with this offender are usually white or even lichenoid, although ulcerative and red lesions may be seen. A related lesion, plasma cell gingivitis, is another form of contact allergy to cinnamon-containing agents such as toothpastes and chewing gums. The condition primarily af- fects the attached gingiva as a bright red bilateral band. This lesion is discussed in Chapter 4.
Histopathology
Microscopically, the epithelium and connective tissue show inflammatory changes. Spongiosis and vesiculation may be seen within the epithelium, and perivascular lymphophago- cytic infiltrate is found in the immediate supporting connec- tive tissue. Blood vessels may be dilated, and occasionally eosinophils may be seen.
Diagnosis
Careful history taking to establish a cause-and-effect rela- tionship is essential. Biopsy findings may be confirmatory. Patch testing of oral mucosa is difficult, and false-negative results may be problematic.
Treatment
Treatment should be directed at elimination of the offend- ing material if it can be identified. In uncomplicated cases, lesions should heal in 1 to 2 weeks. Topical steroids may hasten the healing process.
Wegener’s Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)
Etiology
Wegener’s granulomatosis, renamed granulomatosis with poly- angiitis (GPA), is an uncommon immune-based inflammatory necrotizing vasculitis whose exact cause is unknown. Efforts to identify an infectious agent have been unproductive.
Clinical Features
With an incidence of approximately 3 cases per 100,000, Wegener’s granulomatosis has an equal gender distribution
and a wide age range in which it occurs. White persons are affected in approximately 90% of cases.
Classically, the triad of upper respiratory tract, lung, and kidney involvement is seen in this condition. Occasionally, only two of the three sites are affected. Lesions may also present in the oral cavity and skin and potentially in any other organ system (Figures 2-51 and 2-52).
Initial presentation within the oral cavity is noted in 6% to 13% of cases in the form of painful cobblestone mucosal alterations of the palate and gingiva (hyperplastic, granular alterations) (“strawberry gingivitis”). The clinical differential diagnosis is broad and includes fungal disease, squamous cell carcinoma, lymphoma, infectious granulo- matous disease, Langerhans cell disease, peripheral giant cell lesion, pyogenic granuloma, and, when involving the hard palate, necrotizing sialometaplasia. GPA is often associated with other head and neck manifestations, including parotid gland swelling, facial edema, sinusitis, rhinorrhea, nasal stuffiness, and epistaxis. In most cases, nasal or sinus (usu- ally maxillary) ulcerations are present. Necrosis and perfora- tion of the nasal septum or palate are occasionally seen.

www.konkur.in
Kidney involvement consists of focal necrotizing glo- merulitis. Renal failure is the final outcome of kidney dis- ease. Inflammatory lung lesions, varying in intensity from slight to severe, may eventually lead to respiratory failure.
Histopathology
The basic pathologic process is granulomatous, with charac- teristic necrotizing vasculitis (Figure 2-53). Necrosis and multinucleated giant cells may be seen in granulomatous areas. Affected small vessels show a mononuclear infiltrate within their walls in the presence of fibrinoid necrosis. Diagnosis may be made by exclusion of other diseases, particularly midline granuloma (Table 2-5).
Diagnosis
Diagnosis is generally dependent on the finding of granu- lomatous inflammation and necrotizing vasculitis in biopsy tissue of upper respiratory tract lesions, which is evidence of involvement of lung and/or kidney lesions. Demonstra- tion of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (cANCAs) from indirect immunofluorescence on blood adds confir- matory evidence, but negative results do not necessarily rule out the diagnosis. Antineutrophil perinuclear antibod- ies (pANCAs) represent antibodies to myeloperoxidases and are usually positive in many forms of vasculitis and polyarteritis; they therefore are not specific for Wegener’s
granulomatosis. Positive cANCA results should be con- firmed by more specific studies, including ELISA testing for PR-3, a serine protease within neutrophil granules, and anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO).
Treatment
Before the development of chemotherapeutic agents, renal failure and death were common outcomes of this disease process. Use of the cytotoxic agent cyclophosphamide com- bined with corticosteroids has provided afflicted patients with a relatively favorable prognosis. With treatment, remissions occur in approximately 75% of cases.
Midline Granuloma
Midline granuloma is a diagnosis made by exclusion of other granulomatous and necrotizing midfacial lesions. Because midline granuloma has many features that overlap with Wegener’s granulomatosis, these two conditions were at one time classified together under the rubric midline le- thal granuloma. Most, if not all, cases represent occult pe- ripheral extranodal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphomas.
Clinical Features
Midline granuloma/extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma is a unifocal destructive and aggressive process, generally in the midline of the oronasal region (Figure 2-54). Lesions

appear clinically as necrotic ulcers that are progressive and nonhealing. Extension through soft tissue, cartilage, and bone is typical. Perforation of the nasal septum and hard palate may also be seen. Clinically, other diseases that pro- duce destructive lesions of the midline of the nose or palate include Wegener’s granulomatosis, infectious disease, and carcinoma.
Histopathology
Microscopically, the process appears as acute and chronic inflammation in partially necrotic tissue. Angiocentric in- flammation is a common finding and is typical of many NK/T-cell lymphomas. Because of the almost trivial inflam- matory appearance of this condition, several biopsies may be required before lymphoma can be diagnosed. Immuno- histochemistry and molecular studies will establish NK/ T-cell clonality consistent with lymphoma and there is a strong association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).
Treatment
The treatment of choice is local radiation. It is relatively effec- tive and has produced a reasonably optimistic prognosis in limited disease. In advanced cases, the use of nonanthracy- cline combination chemotherapy may be helpful, although in such instances the prognosis remains poor.
Chronic Granulomatous Disease
Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare systemic (X-linked or autosomal recessive) disease, with the X-linked form demonstrating mutations in one of the CYBA, CYBB, NCF1, NCF2, or NCF4 genes resulting in defects in the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)- oxidase complex and subsequent alterations in neutrophil and macrophage function. These cells, although they have the capacity to phagocytose microorganisms, lack the abil- ity to kill certain bacteria and fungi because of inadequate superoxide and other oxygen metabolites that are toxic to organisms.
Manifestations appear during childhood and, because of the more frequent X-linked inheritance pattern, occur
predominantly in males. The process may affect many organs, including the lymph nodes, lung, liver, spleen, bone, and skin, as recurrent or persistent infections. Oral lesions are frequently seen in the form of multiple ulcers that are also recurrent or persistent. Granulomatous disease and abnormal nitroblue tetrazolium neutrophil function test results would support clinical suspicions.
Cyclic Neutropenia
Cyclic neutropenia, a rare blood dyscrasia, is manifested as severe cyclic reduction or depletion of neutrophils from the blood and marrow, with a mean cycle, or periodicity, of about 21 days. Both autosomal-dominant and some spo- radic forms are due to mutations in the ELANE gene lo- cated at chromosome 19p13.3 that codes for neutrophil elastase. More than 15 different mutations have been found in cyclic neutropenia that result in abnormal neutrophil elastase proteins that appear to have a shorter lifespan than normal. Fever, malaise, oral ulcers, cervical lymphadenopa- thy, and infections may appear during neutropenic episodes in early childhood. Patients are also prone to exaggeration of periodontal disease. Although treatment with granulo- cyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) may be effective, supportive care and strict oral hygiene measures are impor- tant. Early recognition of infection is important in manage- ment, as is judicious use of antibiotics.
Neoplasms
Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Oral Cavity
Relative to the incidence of all cancers, oral and oropharyn- geal squamous cell carcinomas represent about 3% of can- cers in men and 2% of cancers in women. Annually, more than 36,000 new cases of oral and oropharyngeal cancer are expected to occur in men and women in the United States. The ratio of cases in men and women is now about 2 to 1. Previously, this ratio was 3 to 1; this shift has been attrib- uted to an increase in smoking by women and to their longer life expectancy.
Deaths resulting from oral and oropharyngeal cancer represent approximately 2% of the total in men and 1% of the total in women. The total number of estimated annual deaths resulting from oral and oropharyngeal cancer is as high as 7880 in the United States, although a decrease of slightly more than 1.8% was noted in cancer death rates between 1991 and 2006 for this condition.
The trend in survival of patients with this malignancy has been rather disappointing, although recently slight, but significant improvement has been reported. The period be- tween 1999 and 2005 reflects a 63% five-year relative sur- vival rate as compared with a 55% rate in the years between 1984 and 1986 (Figure 2-55). Survival rates for African Americans have been lower than for other races, although a significant rise in survival was documented from 36% in the years between 1984 and 1986 to 46% from 1996 to 2005. Geographic variations in oral and oropharyngeal carcinoma survival rates exist in the United States and

around the world and are most likely attributed to genetic and environmental differences unique to local populations. In India and some other Asian countries, oral cancer is the most common type of malignancy and may account for more than 50% of all cancer cases. This finding is generally linked to the high prevalence of a unique smokeless tobacco habit. The tobacco, typically mixed with areca (betel) nut, slaked lime, and spices, is known as the quid or paan, and is held in the buccal vestibule for long periods. This combi- nation of ingredients, which may vary from one locale to
another, is more carcinogenic than tobacco used alone.
Etiology
Of all factors believed to contribute to the etiology of oral cancer, tobacco is regarded as the most important. All forms of tobacco smoking have been strongly linked to the cause of oral cancer. Smoking of cigars and pipes is linked to greater risk for the development of oral cancer than that associated with cigarette smoking. “Reverse smoking,” the habit of holding the lighted end of the cigarette inside the mouth, as may be the habit in India and some South American countries, is associated with a significantly high risk of oral cancer. This high risk is due to the intensity of tobacco combustion adjacent to palatal and lingual tissues. In any event, the time-dose relationship of carcinogens found in tobacco is of paramount importance in determin- ing the cause of oral cancer. In addition to an overall in- creased risk of development of cancer in all regions of the mouth, pipe smokers appear to have a special predilection for squamous cell carcinoma of the lower lip.
Long-term use of smokeless tobacco, whether in the form of snuff (ground and finely cut tobacco) or chewing tobacco (loose-leaf tobacco), is believed to increase the risk of oral cancer, although the risk level is probably low.
In view of this lower oral cancer risk, some have advocated smokeless tobacco or even e-cigarettes as alternatives to conventional cigarettes, although the rationale for this is suspect when safe, alternative smoking cessation methods exist. In addition, many patients who use smokeless tobacco products also consume cigarettes and alcohol, thereby in- creasing their risk of oral cancer. Moreover, the use of smokeless tobacco carries with it other health risks, such as elevated blood pressure, physiologic dependence, and wors- ening periodontal disease.
Alcohol, although not generally believed to be a car- cinogen itself, appears to add to the risk of oral cancer de- velopment. Identification of alcohol alone as a carcino- genic factor has proved to be somewhat difficult because of the combination of smoking and drinking habits seen in most patients with oral cancer. However, recent epidemio- logic studies suggest that alcohol use alone may increase the risk for oral cancer. The effects of alcohol have been thought to occur through its ability to irritate the mucosa and to act as a solvent for carcinogens (especially those in tobacco). Contaminants and additives with carcinogenic potential that are found in alcoholic drinks have been thought to have a role in the development of oral cancer. Molecular studies have suggested that the carcinogenic risks associated with alcohol may be related to the effects of an alcohol metabolite, acetaldehyde, through alteration of keratinocyte gene expression.
Some microorganisms have been implicated in oral cancer. Candida albicans has been suggested as a possible causative agent because of its potential to produce a carcinogen, N-nitrosobenzylmethylamine. Epstein-Barr virus has been linked to Burkitt’s lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, but not to oral cancer.
Studies have demonstrated the presence of human papil- lomavirus (HPV) subtypes 16 and 18 in 6% to 10% of oral squamous cell carcinomas, suggesting a possible role for this virus in oral cancers. This contrasts with squamous cell carci- noma of the tonsil where 60% to 70% of tumors are positive for these types of HPV. Of note is the difference in the mo- lecular profile of HPV-associated squamous cell carcinoma versus HPV-negative tumors, with the former conferring a positive impact on survival. The status of p16, a cell cycle- regulating protein often overexpressed in tumors infected with oncogenic HPV strains, provides an even better positive prognostic information for carcinomas of the head and neck regardless of HPV status. Verrucous carcinoma was originally reported to be associated with HPV infection but this view is no longer supported by molecular evidence.
Although poor nutritional status has been linked to an increased rise in oral cancer, the only convincing nutritional factor that has been associated with oral cancer is iron defi- ciency of Plummer-Vinson syndrome (also called Patterson- Kelly syndrome or sideropenic dysphagia). Typically affect- ing middle-aged women, the syndrome includes a painful red tongue, mucosal atrophy, dysphagia caused by esopha- geal webs, and a predisposition to the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma.

54 CHAPTER 2 Ulcerative Conditions
Ultraviolet (UV) light is a known carcinogenic agent that is a significant factor in basal cell carcinomas of the skin and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin and lip. The cumulative dose of sunlight and the amount of protection by natural pigmentation are of great significance in the de- velopment of these cancers. In the UV light spectrum, ra- diation with a wavelength of 2900 to 3200 nm (UVB) is more carcinogenic than light of 3200 to 3400 nm (UVA).
A compromised immune system puts patients at risk for oral cancer. This increased risk has been documented for bone marrow and kidney transplant recipients, who are iatrogenically immunosuppressed. The total-body radiation and high-dose chemotherapy that are used to condition patients for bone marrow transplants also put patients at lifelong risk for solid and lymphoid malignancies. In addi- tion to AIDS-defining malignancies such as Kaposi’s sarcoma and some non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas, patients with HIV infection also have a risk of developing several non-AIDS defining cancers, including anal, liver, and lung cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma. It is still not known if there is an increased risk of oral cancer.
Chronic irritation is generally regarded as a modifier rather than an initiator of oral cancer. Mechanical trauma from ill-fitting dentures, broken fillings, and other fric- tional rubs is unlikely to cause oral cancer. If a cancer is started from another cause, these factors will probably has- ten the process. Poor oral hygiene is regarded as having a comparable modifying effect, although many patients with poor oral hygiene have other more important risk fac- tors for oral cancer, such as tobacco habits and alcohol consumption.
Pathogenesis
Oral cancer, similar to most other malignancies, arises from the accumulation of a number of discrete genetic events that lead to invasive cancer (Figures 2-56 to 2-58). These
changes occur in genes that encode for proteins that control the cell cycle, cell survival, cell motility, and angiogenesis. Each genetic mutation confers a selective growth advantage, permitting clonal expansion of mutant cells with increased malignant potential. This process is known as clonal evolu- tion. The multistep genetic progression to cancer was first characterized in colonic mucosa, correlating with the se- quential evolution of normal mucosa to adenomatous pol- yps and then adenocarcinoma. It was shown that a small number of genetic changes were required for acquisition of the malignant phenotype. For example, mutations of the APC and K-ras genes occur early in tumor progression, whereas alterations of p53 and DCC occur more frequently in advanced tumors.
Cytogenetic analysis has shown a series of consistent al- terations in squamous cell carcinoma, including but not limited to losses of 9p21, the site of two tumor suppressor genes (p16 and p14ARF), and 17p13, the site of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, as well as 3p, 13q21, and 18q21. Loss of 9p inactivates the p16 tumor suppressor gene, with a succession of losses of 3p and 17p as dysplasia develops and progresses.
Conceptually, oral cancers progress through two impor- tant biological stages. The first is loss of cell cycle control through increased proliferation and reduced apoptosis. Early in the carcinogenesis process, epidermal growth factor recep- tor (EGFR) and its principal or main ligand or binding protein, transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-a), are upregulated, thus establishing an autocrine activation loop. Although levels of TGF-a remain stable with increasing degrees of dysplasia, EGFR expression increases and be- comes markedly elevated in fully transformed squamous cell carcinoma. Histologically, the impact of the molecular al- terations is most obvious in patients with in situ carcinoma, in which an increased number of dividing cells can be seen in all levels of the epithelium.

neoplastic cell motility, leading to invasion and metastasis. Here, neoplastic epithelial cells penetrate the basement membrane and invade underlying tissues, eventually reach- ing regional lymph nodes. Elements associated with local invasiveness and increased metastatic potential with corre- spondingly poorer clinical outcomes are certain members of the MMP family, in particular MMP 2, 9, and 13.
Both stages result from activation (upregulation) of oncogenes and inactivation (downregulation) of tumor sup- pressor genes (Box 2-14). Oncogenes, under normal cir- cumstances, encode proteins that positively regulate critical cell growth functions, such as proliferation, apoptosis, cell motility, membrane and internal cell signaling, and angio- genesis. If these genes are altered through one of several

mechanisms (e.g., mutation), overexpression of the encoded protein occurs, giving rise to a clone of cells with a growth/ motility advantage. Tumor suppressor genes encode pro- teins that negatively regulate or suppress proliferation. Al- teration of these genes (changes in both maternal and pater- nal alleles are required) essentially “releases the brake” on proliferation for a clone of cells. Tumor suppressor genes are believed to play a more important role in oral cancer devel- opment than oncogenes.
Alterations of genes that control the cell cycle seem to be of critical importance in the development of oral cancer. Normally, cell division is divided into four phases: G1 (gap 1), S (DNA synthesis), G2 (gap 2), and M (mitosis). A key event is the progression from the G1 to the S phase. Genetic alterations, if unrepaired in the G1 phase, may be carried into the S phase and perpetuated in subsequent cell divi- sions. The G1-S “checkpoint” is normally regulated by a well-coordinated and complex system of protein interac- tions whose balance and function are critical to normal cell division. Overexpression of oncogenic proteins or underex- pression of antioncogenic proteins can tip the balance in favor of proliferation and neoplastic transformation. For example, p53 normally is a tumor suppressor gene and a key negative regulator at G1-S of the cell cycle. In about 50% of oral cancers, p53 is mutated and its encoded pro- tein is nonfunctional (Figure 2-59). Defective p53 protein allows cells to proceed into the S phase of the cell cycle before DNA can be repaired. The result is an accumulation of deleterious genetic defects that contribute to malignant
• Figure 2-59 Positive nuclear p53 staining in oral cancer. (Repro- duced with permission from Regezi JA, Sciubba JJ, Pogrel MA: Atlas of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology. Philadelphia, 2000, WB Saunders, Fig. 1-6.)
transformation. This key protein may be dysregulated in oral precancer as well and may serve as an indicator of high- risk lesions. The MDM2 protein mediates the degradation of p53 and is frequently overexpressed in oral cancers.
Overexpression of the cyclin D1 protein can be identi- fied in many oral cancers, leading to increased proliferation and premature progression through the G1-S checkpoint. Two important groups of intrinsic cell cycle proteins that regulate proliferation are cyclins and their catalytic binding enzymes, the cyclin-dependent kinases. In turn, a class of inhibitory proteins known as cyclin-dependent kinase in- hibitors regulates these proteins. Reduced expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p16ink4a and p27kip1, is another important feature of oral cancer and is associated with loss of cell cycle control and increased proliferation.
The biological antithesis of proliferation is apoptosis (programmed cell death). If cells live longer, they may have a biological advantage that favors the development of neo- plasia. Some genes that control apoptosis are altered in cancers (e.g., BCL-2 gene, which is overexpressed in mantle cell lymphomas as a result of a chromosome translocation). In oral cancers, several proteins that regulate apoptosis (cas- pases, Bcl-2, and Bcl-X) are often dysregulated. The pro- apoptotic protein Bax has been positively correlated with increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents in head and neck cancers.
Several other oncogenes that function in regulating cell growth and transporting signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus are frequently altered in many oral cancers. These include genes that code for growth factors, such as int-2 and hst-1 (fibroblast growth factor); growth factor receptors, such as HER1 (EGFR), HER2 (HER2/neu), HER3, and HER4; proteins involved in signal transduc- tion, such as ras (guanosine triphosphate [GTP]-binding proteins); and nuclear regulatory proteins, such as myc (transcriptional activator proteins). Correlations have now been identified between growth receptor overexpression and patient outcome. Of particular importance is EGFR (HER1), a tyrosine kinase membrane receptor protein that is often overexpressed in oral cancers. Inhibitory antibodies and molecules that are directed against component parts of the EGFR protein (cetuximab, erlotnib) have been shown to enhance the efficacy of radiation and chemotherapy in patients with head and neck cancers and to improve sur- vival. These agents are in clinical use for several cancers, including oral and lung cancers.
Many oral cancers pass through a premalignant phase (dysplasia or in situ carcinoma), whereas others appear to arise de novo without clinical or microscopic evidence of a preexisting lesion. Invasive carcinomas have developed the ability to penetrate basement membrane and connective tissue, as well as enter the vascular system. These tumors are believed to have developed this biological advantage through molecular lesions in genes and proteins associated with cell movement and extracellular matrix degradation. Changes in the phenotype of cell adhesion molecules (e.g., cadher- ins, integrins) release cells from their normal environment

and give them the ability to migrate. This, coupled with enzymatic degradation of the basement membrane and connective tissue, provides the necessary components for invasion of the proliferating tumor.
Critical cell adhesion proteins are frequently altered in invasive oral cancer. These include intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM), e-cadherin, and the neoexpression of beta-6 integrin, a protein that assists keratinocyte motility. Matrix-related proteins produced by tumor cells and possi- bly by connective tissue elements (e.g., fibroblasts, macro- phages) contribute to the breakdown of basement mem- brane and extracellular matrix proteins. Tenascin, an antiadhesion molecule not evident in normal mucosa, is frequently detected in oral squamous cell carcinomas. MMP 1, 2, 9, and 13 have been demonstrated in invasive carcinomas and are believed to play a significant role in the degradation of connective tissue elements. In particular, MMP 3 and 13 are associated with advanced head and neck carcinomas.
For tumors to grow much larger than 1 mm, a new blood supply is required (angiogenesis). This occurs through tumor-mediated induction or overexpression of angiogenic proteins (e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF], basic fibroblastic growth factor [FGF]) and/or suppression of proteins that inhibit angiogenesis. VEGF, FGF, and inter- leukin 8 (IL-8), a proinflammatory cytokine, have been identified in head and neck cancers and are believed to be responsible, at least in part, for the angiogenesis associated with the progression of these tumors. The genetic alteration leading to overexpression of these proteins has not been fully determined, but it likely involves interactions with other critical oncogenes and immunosuppressor genes.
Another important feature of cancer cells is the increased replicative lifespan. Telomeres are DNA-protein complexes found at the ends of chromosomes that are required for chromosome stability. Normal cells have a finite lifespan related to telomere shortening that occurs with each succes- sive cell division. When a critical telomere reduction is reached, the chromosome and subsequently the cell are subject to degradation. Cancer cells often develop a mecha- nism to maintain telomere length and chromosome integ- rity and thus long-term viability. This is associated with the production of telomerase, an intranuclear enzyme that is not present in normal adult cells but is found in cancer cells. Most head and neck carcinomas have telomerase ac- tivity through neoexpression of the enzyme, giving the neoplastic cell extended life.
Clinical Features
Carcinoma of the Lips. From a biological viewpoint, carcinomas of the vermilion portion of the lower lip are separated from those of the upper lip. Carcinomas of the lower lip are far more common than upper lip lesions (Figures 2-60 and 2-61). UV light and pipe smoking are more important in the cause of lower lip cancer than in the cause of upper lip cancer. The growth rate is slower for lower lip cancers than for upper lip cancers. The prognosis
• Figure 2-60 Squamous cell carcinoma of the lip.
• Figure 2-61 Exophytic squamous cell carcinoma of the lip.
for lower lip lesions is generally very favorable, with more than 90% of patients alive after 5 years. By contrast, the prognosis for upper lip lesions is considerably worse.
Lip carcinomas account for 25% to 30% of all oral cancers. They appear most commonly in patients between 50 and 70 years of age and affect men much more often than women. Some mineral components of lipstick such as titanium dioxide and zinc oxide have sunscreen proper- ties that account, in part, for this finding, although occu- pational exposure to sunlight is more of a factor in men. Lesions arise on the vermilion and typically appear as chronic nonhealing ulcers or as exophytic lesions that are occasionally verrucous in nature. Deep invasion generally appears later in the course of the disease. Metastasis to lo- cal submental or submandibular lymph nodes is uncom- mon but is more likely with larger, more poorly differenti- ated lesions.
Carcinoma of the Tongue. Squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue is the most common intraoral malignancy. Ex- cluding lip lesions, it accounts for between 25% and 40% of oral carcinomas. It has a definite predilection for men in their sixth, seventh, and eighth decades. However, lesions may be found uncommonly in the very young. These lesions often exhibit particularly aggressive behavior.

Lingual carcinoma is typically asymptomatic. In later stages, as deep invasion occurs, pain or dysphagia may be a prominent patient complaint. Similar to other oral cancers, these present in one of four ways: as an indurated, nonheal- ing ulcer; as a red lesion; as a white lesion; or as a red-and- white lesion (Figures 2-62 to 2-65). The neoplasm may oc- casionally have a prominent exophytic, as well as endophytic,

growth pattern. A small percentage of leukoplakias of the tongue represent invasive squamous cell carcinoma or even- tually become squamous cell carcinoma. Most erythroplakic patches that appear on the tongue are in situ or invasive squamous cell carcinomas at the time of discovery.
The most common location of cancer of the tongue is the posterior-lateral border, accounting for as many as 45% of tongue lesions. Lesions very uncommonly develop on the dorsum or on the tip of the tongue. Approximately 25% of tongue cancers occur in the posterior one third or base of the tongue. These lesions are more troublesome than the others because of their silent progression in an area that is difficult to visualize. Accordingly, these lesions more often are advanced or have metastasized regionally by the time they are discovered, reflecting a significantly poorer progno- sis than for lesions of the anterior two thirds with the excep- tion of HPV-positive tongue base carcinomas in those who do not smoke or consume excessive amounts of alcohol, where the overall prognosis is far better than in smoking and alcohol-related carcinomas at this site.
Metastases from tongue cancer are relatively common at the time of primary treatment. In general, metastatic depos- its from squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue are found in the lymph nodes of the neck, usually on the ipsilateral (same) side. The first nodes to become involved are the submandibular or jugulodigastric nodes at the angle of the mandible (anatomic levels I and II). Uncommonly, distant metastatic deposits may be seen in the lung or the liver.
Carcinoma of the Floor of the Mouth. The floor of mouth is the second most common intraoral location of squamous cell carcinoma, accounting for 15% to 20% of cases. Again, carcinomas in this location occur predomi- nantly in older men, especially those who are chronic alco- holics and smokers. The usual presenting appearance is that of a painless, nonhealing, indurated ulcer (Figure 2-66). It may appear as a white or red patch (Figure 2-67). The lesion occasionally may widely infiltrate the soft tissues of the floor of mouth, causing decreased mobility of the tongue (Figures 2-68 and 2-69). Metastasis to submandibular lymph nodes is not uncommon for lesions of the floor of mouth.

Carcinoma of the Buccal Mucosa and Gingiva. Lesions of the buccal mucosa and lesions of the gingiva each ac- count for approximately 10% of oral squamous cell carci- nomas. Men in their seventh decade typify the affected group. The presenting clinical appearance varies from a white patch to a nonhealing ulcer to an exophytic lesion (Figure 2-70). In the latter group is the clinically pathologic entity verrucous carcinoma. This subset of squamous cell carcinoma, sometimes associated with the use of smokeless tobacco, presents as a broad-based, wartlike mass. It is slow

growing and is very well differentiated, rarely metastasizes, and has a very favorable prognosis.
Carcinoma of the Palate. There is some justification for separation of cancers of the hard palate from those of the soft palate. In the soft palate and contiguous faucial tissues, squamous cell carcinoma is a fairly common occurrence, accounting for 10% to 20% of intraoral lesions. In the hard palate, squamous cell carcinomas are relatively rare. By con- trast, salivary gland adenocarcinomas are relatively common in the palate. However, palatal carcinomas are commonly encountered in countries such as India, where reverse smok- ing is common.
Palatal squamous cell carcinomas generally present as asymptomatic red or white plaques or as ulcerated and kera- totic masses (adenocarcinomas initially appear as nonulcer- ated masses) (Figure 2-71). Metastasis to cervical nodes or large lesions signifies an ominous course (Figures 2-72 and 2-73).
Histopathology
Most oral squamous cell carcinomas are moderately differ- entiated or well-differentiated lesions (Figures 2-74 and 2-75). Keratin pearls and individual cell keratinization are usually evident. Invasion into subjacent structures in the

form of small nests of hyperchromatic cells is typical. In situ carcinoma extension into salivary excretory ducts (sialade- notropism) can be regarded as a high-risk microscopic indi- cator of potential recurrence but does not necessarily define invasion. Considerable variation between tumors is seen relative to the numbers of mitoses, nuclear pleomorphism,
and the amount of keratinization. In H&E-stained sections of poorly differentiated lesions, keratin is absent or is seen in minute amounts. However, it can be identified using im- munohistochemical techniques for the demonstration of antigenic determinants on otherwise occult keratin inter- mediate filaments. A significant inflammatory host response is usually noted surrounding the nests of invading tumor cells. Lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages may all be seen in large numbers.
Rarely, an oral squamous cell carcinoma appears as a proliferation of spindle cells that may be mistaken for a sarcoma. This type of tumor, known as spindle cell carci- noma or sarcomatoid carcinoma, arises from the surface epithelium, usually of the lips and occasionally of the tongue. Immunohistochemical staining can be used to identify keratin antigens in this lesion when H&E-stained sections show equivocal findings (Figure 2-76).
Verrucous carcinoma is characterized by very well- differentiated epithelial cells that appear more hyperplastic than neoplastic. A key feature is the invasive nature of the lesion in the form of broad, pushing margins. The advancing front is usually surrounded by lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages. Diagnosis based solely on microscopic features is often difficult; it is frequently necessary to consider the lesion in the context of clinical presentation. Papillary squamous cell carcinoma resembles verrucous carcinoma but is less differentiated and has a poorer prognosis.
Another microscopic variant or distinctive subset of squamous carcinoma that has a predilection for the base of the tongue and pharynx is biologically highly malignant and is known as basaloid-squamous carcinoma. In these tumors, a basaloid pattern of tumor cells is seen adjacent to tumor cells that exhibit squamous differentiation. This tumor may be confused microscopically with basaloid adenoid cystic carcinoma and adenosquamous carcinoma. Separation of the microscopically identical basaloid squa- mous cell carcinoma into human papillomavirus 16 posi- tive and negative forms by using in situ hybridization techniques has led to the recognition of a less aggressive pattern of behavior in HPV 16–positive cases as compared with their HPV 16–negative counterparts, and thus an improved clinical outcome.
Differential Diagnosis
When oral squamous cell carcinomas present in their typi- cal clinical form of chronic, nonhealing ulcers, other ulcer- ative conditions should be considered. An undiagnosed chronic ulcer must always be considered potentially infec- tious until biopsy findings prove otherwise. It may be im- possible on clinical grounds to separate TB, syphilis, and deep (invasive) fungal infections expressing oral manifesta- tions from oral cancer. Chronic trauma, including factitial or self-induced injury, may mimic squamous cell carci- noma. Careful history taking is especially important, and biopsy findings confirm the diagnosis. In the palate and contiguous tissues, midline granuloma and necrotizing si- alometaplasia would be serious diagnostic considerations.

Surgical Management of Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Oral Cavity
Eric Carlson, DMD, MD
General clinical experience with patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity shows that they most com- monly present with one of the four following clinical
scenarios: early disease (T1-2, N0), locally advanced disease (T3-4, N0), locally and regionally advanced disease (T4, N1-2), or nonresectable disease. Treatment of resect- able squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity is based on the location and stage of the primary tumor. As such, local surgery of the primary tumor, as well as regional surgery of the neck nodes, is considered and individually planned for each patient. Local surgery of the primary tumor must con- sider the removal of soft tissue and bone, as indicated. Re- moval of the cancer in soft tissue is referred to as a wide local excision, incorporating a 1.0- to 1.5-cm linear margin of clinically normal-appearing soft tissue at the periphery of the specimen. A partial glossectomy, or hemiglossectomy, is a specific type of wide local excision indicated for the man- agement of malignant disease of the tongue. Removal of squamous cell carcinoma in bone is referred to as a resec- tion, incorporating a 2-cm linear margin of radiographi- cally normal-appearing bone at the periphery of the speci- men. Mandibular resections are subclassified as marginal resections whereby the inferior border of the mandible is preserved, or as segmental resections whereby the full height of the mandible is sacrificed, thereby creating a defect in continuity of the mandible. Disarticulation resections are a

variant of segmental mandibular resection whereby the temporomandibular joint is sacrificed. A composite resec- tion, a commonly performed ablative surgery for oral squa- mous cell carcinoma, includes the sacrifice of hard and soft tissue. Typically, composite resections include a monobloc sacrifice of neck nodes, the mandible, and soft tissues cor- responding to the primary tumor in the tongue or the floor of mouth, for example (Figure 2-77).
Management of the neck is perhaps one of the most in- teresting and controversial aspects of the surgical manage- ment of oral squamous cell carcinoma. Neck dissections are performed in one of three instances. The first is when pal- pable cervical lymphadenopathy exists. A neck examination must be performed before an incisional biopsy of a suspi- cious oral lesion is performed. This examination of the neck is one part of tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) staging and is performed even before a definitive diagnosis of squa- mous cell carcinoma is established. The N stage is entirely clinically based, and the TNM classification is not modified if computed tomography (CT) scan findings contradict the clinical examination.
The second indication for neck dissection includes posi- tive lymphadenopathy divulged by special imaging studies
• Figure 2-77 Composite resection performed for T4, N0, M0 squa- mous cell carcinoma of the anterior floor of mouth. The specimen consists of a monobloc resection of the floor of mouth, mandible, and ipsilateral neck nodes.
(CT or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]). It is possible that a clinical examination may result in an N0 classifica- tion, whereas the patient’s imaging study may reveal en- larged lymph nodes with hypodense (necrotic) centers, likely indicative of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. This scenario may occur in obese patients whose clinical neck examinations are unreliable. Nonetheless, under such circumstances, neck staging remains N0 and a neck dissec- tion is indicated. CT and MRI studies provide very sophis- ticated anatomic assessments of lymph nodes in the neck (Figure 2-78, A). Yet, in many patients, identification of mildly enlarged lymph nodes can be due to the incisional biopsy used to establish the diagnosis of the patient’s cancer, or other causes. Functional, or molecular, imaging repre- sents an opportunity to distinguish lymph nodes containing cancer from those that are mildly enlarged for another rea- son (Figure 2-78, B). Molecular imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and a glucose biomarker, 18[F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), has become increasingly widely used to diagnose and stage malignant disease. The ability of PET to accurately stage malignant disease depends on the tumor size, the physical specifications of the PET scanner, and the avidity of cancer cells to take up FDG. Recently, fusion devices that image both anatomy (CT) and function (PET) have been developed, offering the best of both worlds: functional abnormalities can be localized ac- curately, and the functional status of anatomic abnormali- ties can be assessed immediately. Clinical observation using PET/CT scanning in oral/head and neck cancer patients indicates three advantages of this new technology:
• Assessment of subclinical disease in the lymph nodes in the neck is possible, which might alter the neck surgery treatment plan (Figure 2-79).
• Early assessment of synchronous second primary cancers is possible.
• Assessment of distant metastatic disease is possible, which might result in the refinement of treatment rec- ommendations. Identification of disseminated metasta- ses might change a treatment plan from surgical to nonsurgical.
The third, and most thought-provoking, indication for neck dissection is management of the neck when lymph- adenopathy is not apparent. Occult neck disease is defined as cancer present in lymph nodes in the neck that cannot be palpated clinically and do not appear on special imaging studies. As such, these neck dissections are performed for N0 disease. Numerous studies have examined the likeli- hood of occult neck disease as a function of the anatomic site of the primary cancer and as a function of its size and thickness. These studies clearly show that early squamous cell carcinoma of the oral tongue (T1-2, N0) may be associ- ated with occult neck disease in nearly 40% of cases. This explains why many surgeons advocate performing a neck dissection for early squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. Early disease of the floor of mouth (followed by disease of the buccal mucosa, maxillary gingiva, mandibular gingiva, and lip) carries a quantitatively lower, yet significant, risk of

occult neck disease. Therefore, prophylactic neck dissec- tions play an important role in the management of many early squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity, and should be performed when the risk of occult neck disease is quantified as being greater than 20%.
Performance of bilateral neck dissections is occasionally required in the management of oral squamous cell carci- noma. Indications include midline primary cancers that are defined as being present in the affected anatomic structure (e.g., tongue, floor of mouth, gingiva) within 1 cm of the midline of the oral cavity and those cancers that cross the midline. Under such circumstances, the neck may be classi- fied as bilateral N0 or ipsilateral N1 and contralateral N0. The bilateral N1 neck may also be encountered. In one study of 66 patients in whom elective dissection of the con- tralateral neck was performed, the rate of occult contralat- eral neck metastasis was found to be 21% when ipsilateral cervical lymph node metastasis was noted histologically. These data point to the need to consider contralateral neck surgery for patients in whom an ipsilateral N1 neck exists, particularly when managing midline or bilateral primary cancers.
Neck dissections may be classified as comprehensive or selective. Comprehensive neck dissections include the radi- cal neck dissection and the modified radical neck dissection (MRND). Both are performed when patients present with palpable (N1) cervical lymphadenopathy. By definition, the radical neck dissection removes lymph nodes in oncologic levels I to V of the neck (Figure 2-80), along with the ster- nocleidomastoid muscle, the internal jugular vein, and the
spinal accessory nerve. Owing to the observation that the spinal accessory nerve is rarely involved in the cancer, the more commonly performed MRND is described. The MRND sacrifices lymph nodes in levels I to V, yet preserves the sternocleidomastoid muscle or the internal jugular vein or, commonly, the spinal accessory nerve. The type 1 MRND preserves the spinal accessory nerve while sacrificing all of the aforementioned structures (Figure 2-81).
Selective neck dissections, most commonly performed for the N0 neck, sacrifice lymph nodes exclusively. By defi- nition, then, the sternocleidomastoid muscle, internal jugu- lar vein, and spinal accessory nerve are intentionally pre- served. The supraomohyoid neck dissection, the most common type of selective neck dissection, removes lymph node levels I to III (Figure 2-82). This neck dissection, therefore, is indicated in managing the N0 neck with a high likelihood of occult neck disease.
When bilateral neck dissections are required in the man- agement of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma, maintenance of at least one internal jugular vein is required to avoid intraoperative/postoperative complications such as superior vena cava syndrome, stroke, and a syndrome of
•Figure2-81 Specimenfromatype1modifiedradicalneckdissec- tion. The internal jugular vein is noted on the medial aspect of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The spinal accessory innervation of the trapezius muscle remains intact in this type of neck dissection.

inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). If bilateral internal jugular veins must be sacrificed, staging neck dissections should occur following a 3-week period from the time of initial neck dissection. When a midline or bilateral primary cancer of the oral cavity exists in associa- tion with an ipsilateral N1 neck and a contralateral N0 neck, an ipsilateral comprehensive neck dissection ought to be performed in conjunction with a contralateral suprao- mohyoid neck dissection. When a midline or bilateral pri- mary cancer of the oral cavity exists in association with a bilateral N0 neck, bilateral supraomohyoid neck dissections are indicated (Figure 2-83).
Surgical management of squamous cell carcinoma ulti- mately is based on decision making for optimal control of local disease while existing or potential lymph node drain- age in the neck is addressed. The use of radiation therapy often plays a role in the sole management of squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, with or without chemotherapy, or as an adjunct in the postoperative phase. It is sound practice that administration of radiation therapy should be planned after a thorough review of the patient’s histopathol- ogy. General indications for postoperative administration of radiation therapy include the following:
• Positive soft tissue margin
• More than one positive lymph node without extracapsu-
lar invasion
• Figure 2-83 A, A squamous cell carcinoma of the right floor of mouth/ventral tongue that crosses the midline. B, This patient has NO disease such that bilateral supraomohyoid neck dissections are per- formed.
• One or more lymph nodes with extracapsular invasion • Bone invasion by the cancer, even with negative bone
margins
• Perineural invasion in the specimen
• The presence of comorbid immunosuppressive disease,
such as HIV/AIDS
This approach represents a departure from the previously accepted dogma that radiation therapy is administered to most, if not all, postoperative patients. Therefore, surgery and radiation therapy are tailored to each patient’s specific cancer, rather than treating all patients in a similar fashion. Unfortunately, despite numerous refinements in surgery and radiation therapy, the 5-year survival rate for all pa- tients with squamous cell carcinoma (including all sites and stages) has improved minimally in the past 50 years.
Radiotherapy Management of Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Oral Cavity
John Kim, MD
Clinical Evaluation
Patients with biopsy-proven squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oral cavity should undergo a complete history and physical examination. The clinical examination in- cludes indirect mirror laryngoscopy and/or direct flexible fiberoptic naso-laryngoscopy and pharyngoscopy to rule out synchronous head and neck primary cancers and to as- sess the airway of patients with large tumors. The primary site and regional lymph nodes are imaged with CT scan and/or MRI scan. PET scanning may help identify sub- clinical primary disease extension, occult neck nodal dis- ease, and systemic metastases. PET scanning involves the injection of a metabolite that is normally taken up by nor- mal tissues or tumors. These metabolites are labeled with radioactive isotopes that allow radiographic detection of these “tracer” compounds. FDG is most commonly used for head and neck cancers exploiting the active metabolism of glucose by tumors. Several investigational tracer com- pounds may have clinical application for head and neck cancers. An example is 18[F]-misonidazole (FMISO). FMISO is preferentially taken up by hypoxic cells; there- fore, hypoxic tumor regions can be detected. Hypoxic tu- mors may be less responsive to radiation. PET scans do not provide anatomic spatial details. Combining PET and CT imaging (registration) can provide more detailed anatomic correlation of areas of increased uptake that may represent tumor. PET scans can play a role in the assessment of tumor response following therapy; a novel role is the use of PET scanning in radiotherapy target delineation and planning.
A dental panoramic radiograph is obtained to assess both dental status and possible mandibular involvement of oral cavity tumors. Other staging and baseline investigations in- clude blood work (complete blood count, electrolytes, renal function, liver enzymes, and thyroid function tests) and chest x-ray or CT scan of the thorax. CT scan or ultrasound of the liver and a bone scan are warranted in some patients with advanced disease or systemic symptoms (e.g., bone pain).

Patients are staged according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer’s (AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual or the International Union Against Cancer’s (UICC) Classifi- cation of Malignant Tumors. Radiotherapy patients require a pretreatment dental consultation regardless of whether they are dentate or edentulous. The attending dentist should have knowledge of radiotherapy volumes, specifi- cally, high-dose volumes. Some patients will require dental extractions within the high-dose radiotherapy treatment volumes; this should be done before treatment is provided. Teeth that are loose or periodontally involved, those with large or unrestorable caries, those with apical pathology, and those that are impacted should be extracted before radiation therapy. Any questionable tooth should be ex- tracted and should not be given the benefit of the doubt because osteoradionecrosis poses a serious problem for the patient.
Routine dental procedures should also take place before treatment. Fluoride carrier trays are constructed for dentate patients for the daily application of neutral pH topical fluo- ride, which continues for the remainder of the patient’s life. Patients are also educated on the importance of maintaining meticulous dental hygiene, which is essential to minimize the risks of increased rates of dental caries in xerostomic (dry mouth) patients and osteoradionecrosis of the mandi- ble post radiotherapy.
Primary Radiotherapy. Advances in surgical ablation and reconstruction with excellent cosmetic and functional outcomes have led to most institutions adopting primary surgery as standard management of most oral cavity can- cers. However, radiotherapy as the primary treatment mo- dality is an option for patients with oral cavity carcinomas. Primary radiotherapy should be considered for all patients who are not candidates for surgery. Modalities of radiation treatment delivery include conventional or conformal exter- nal beam radiotherapy (EBRT), intensity-modulated radia- tion therapy (IMRT), and brachytherapy. EBRT is delivered with photons alone, or in combination with electrons. Usu- ally, multiple treatment fields (or portals) are used. The principle of EBRT is to encompass the gross oral cavity (primary) disease and a surrounding margin. This addi- tional margin allows the inclusion of potential local micro- scopic spread of cancer, day-to-day variation in treatment set-up, patient movement, organ movement (e.g., swallow- ing), and buildup of the radiation dose at the edge of the radiation beam (penumbra). Patient movement is mini- mized with the use of immobilization devices. All patients undergoing head and neck irradiation are immobilized with a neck rest and mask immobilization (Figure 2-84) or with bite block devices. Regional lymph nodes (primary echelon lymph nodes) at risk for harboring microscopic or occult disease are usually included in the radiotherapy fields, even for patients who present with clinical N0 necks. In one study, occult nodal metastases were detected in 49% of pa- tients with clinical T1-T3, N0 carcinomas of the oral cavity who underwent elective neck dissection. Ipsilateral neck node levels I and II are at highest risk for occult metastases
• Figure 2-84 Example of head and neck mask immobilization.
(see description of oncologic node region levels earlier in this chapter). Some oral cavity SCCs such as tongue cancers can metastasize to lower neck nodes without upper neck involvement. Midline lesions are at higher risk than unilat- eral lesions for bilateral occult nodal metastases. Areas of potential occult disease are treated to a lower dose than ar- eas of gross disease. Gross nodal disease is usually treated with the same dose as the primary oral cavity cancer.
Radiotherapy side effects result from irradiation of nor- mal tissues that cannot be excluded from the treatment portal. For all or part of the treatment, some critical normal tissues may be excluded from one or more of the radiation fields by the use of shielding or beam-shaping devices intro- duced in the radiation beam. Normal structures can be avoided by using beam geometries that completely avoid critical structures from one or more of the radiation fields. For example, ipsilateral EBRT techniques can be used to avoid the contralateral parotid and to preserve salivary func- tion postradiotherapy (Figure 2-85). CT-based radiother- apy planning systems allow more accurate identification of gross disease and normal structures.
Conformal radiotherapy techniques such as three- dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) and IMRT may offer better tumor coverage and sparing of normal tis- sues. State-of-the-art CT-based planning software and ra- diation treatment units are used to plan and deliver IMRT. IMRT is a form of 3DCRT. Unlike IMRT, the beam inten- sity across each radiation field is uniform in conventional EBRT and 3DCRT. The beam intensity across each IMRT treatment field is varied in a complex manner that enables shaping of the radiation dose, thus allowing for conformal target coverage while avoiding nearby normal tissues. A common IMRT planning goal is to preserve parotid gland function (parotid-sparing) and avoid permanent xerosto- mia. The ability to create a steep radiation dose gradient (high dose to low dose over a very small distance) is an important feature of IMRT. Tumors close to a critical nor- mal structure, such as the spinal cord, can be treated

adequately while avoiding serious toxicity to the nearby critical structure. For oral cavity carcinomas, parotid-spar- ing and limiting radiation dose to uninvolved oral mucosa and mandible are potential benefits of IMRT (Figure 2-86).
Ensuring daily accurate and precise treatment delivery is a critical quality assurance activity in radiotherapy. Daily
variations in dose delivery can result from set-up variation (displacements or errors) of the patient position compared to the planning CT scan patient position. In addition, daily variation can result from internal motion variation such as swallowing or changes in soft tissues (edema) and tumor (regression) over the course of a treatment period. These

variations could result in a delivered radiation dose that does not match exactly the planned dose. Sophisticated three-dimensional treatment delivery image verification sys- tems to minimize patient (and tumor) set up and internal motion variation are now commercially available. Image- guided radiation therapy (IGRT) is becoming routine clinical practice and can be performed as a daily check prior to the actual radiation treatment delivery. For example, a specialized cone-beam CT scan (CBCT) three-dimensional reconstructed image can be acquired with the patient in the treatment position. This CBCT scan can be compared to the original planning CT scan and displacements (errors) can be corrected prior to the treatment delivery (online verification).
Brachytherapy is a treatment method that delivers very high, but localized radiation doses. It involves the place- ment of radioactive sources in the tumor bed. A type of brachytherapy called interstitial implant, or interstitial ra- diotherapy (ISRT), can be used to treat oral cavity carcino- mas in the floor of mouth or tongue (alone or in combina- tion with EBRT). This technique requires a general anesthetic. One method of ISRT involves the surgical place- ment of catheters through the tumor bed, which can then be loaded with radioactive sources when the patient is trans- ferred to a room with proper radiation protection (after- loading technique). Good 5-year local control rates (as high
as 95%) have been achieved for early (T1, T2) oral tongue lesions, but a range of 50% to 95% has been reported. Some authors advocate the importance of ISRT in the ra- diotherapy management of tongue lesions. However, risks of soft tissue necrosis and osteoradionecrosis of the mandi- ble have been well described with this technique. Primary surgery is now recommended for these patients because of the absence of risk of osteoradionecrosis of the mandible, good local control rates, good functional outcomes (speech and swallowing), and surgical expertise. Primary radiother- apy for oral tongue carcinomas is an option for patients who are not suitable for primary surgery.
No randomized trials have compared primary radio- therapy with primary surgery for the management of oral cavity carcinomas. Both treatment methods are effective. The principle of therapy for patients with oral cavity SCC is to offer the greatest potential for cure while limiting early and long-term side effects. Treatment effects on normal or- gan function as well as cosmesis should be taken into ac- count before therapy is recommended. For patients with oral cavity SCC, preservation of normal organ functions such as speech and swallowing and maintenance of salivary flow (parotid gland function) are important considerations. For example, patients with stage I or II retromolar trigone carcinomas can be managed effectively with primary radio- therapy, reserving surgery for salvage of radiotherapy fail- ure. These patients can often be treated with EBRT alone with good local control rates. Use of an ipsilateral radio- therapy technique to avoid the contralateral parotid gland is often possible (see Figure 2-85).
Some patients will not be eligible for radiotherapy. Previous high-dose head and neck radiotherapy limits retreat- ment radiation doses. Relative contraindications for radio- therapy include extensive bone or cartilage invasion, collagen vascular disorders (particularly scleroderma), previous low- dose radiotherapy, and young age. Some patients will refuse radiotherapy.
Conventional (Standard) Dose-Fractionation Schedules.
A course of conventional EBRT is fractionated over a pro- tracted period because the dose per fraction is known to directly correlate with late normal tissue toxicity (side ef- fects occurring after completion of radiotherapy). Standard or conventional fraction sizes range from 1.8 to 2.5 gray (Gy) per fraction. A common North American dose- fractionation schedule delivers a total of 66 to 70 Gy in 2 Gy per fraction over 6.5 to 7 weeks (not including week- ends) to gross disease, and 50 Gy in 2 Gy per fraction over 5 weeks to potential occult microscopic disease.
Nonconventional (Altered) Fractionation Schedules.
Hyperfractionation is a dose-escalation strategy used to spare late normal tissue toxicity by decreasing the dose per fraction. The total radiotherapy dose can be increased while late toxicity is not increased. Multiple doses per day are used so that the overall duration of treatment is not in- creased. Acceleration is the delivery of multiple courses of near conventional fraction sizes, but in an overall shorter treatment period. This strategy is used to overcome the
 
www.konkur.in
potential detrimental effects of cancer cell repopulation that can occur during a course of radiotherapy. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG), now called NRG On- cology, conducted a randomized clinical trial that demon- strated the benefit of hyperfractionation and an acceleration variant (concomitant boost), compared with standard frac- tionation radiotherapy for head and neck SCC (HNSCC), including locally advanced (stage III and IV) carcinomas. A significant improvement in local-regional control for hyper- fractionation and concomitant boost schedules was noted compared with the standard fractionation schedule. Two- year local-regional control rates were 54.4% (P 5 .045), 54.5% (P 5 .05), and 46%, respectively. A trend toward increased disease-free survival was noted for the hyperfrac- tionation and accelerated (concomitant boost) schedules. A recent meta-analysis of altered fractionation randomized trials reported a survival benefit of 3.4% and a local- regional control benefit of 6.4% compared with conven- tional fractionated schedules.
Concurrent Chemotherapy (Chemoradiation). Individ- ual clinical trials have produced conflicting results regarding the benefit of adding chemotherapy to radiotherapy. Despite this, meta-analyses of many randomized clinical trials of ra- diotherapy combined with neoadjuvant (before radiother- apy), concurrent (during radiotherapy), or adjuvant (after radiotherapy) chemotherapy have shown the most promis- ing results for concurrent chemotherapy. Improvement in overall survival in the range of 8% to 10% has been demon- strated for locally advanced HNSCC. Cisplatin is the most active single agent; therefore, platinum-based regimens are most commonly used in the treatment of HNSCCs. A typi- cal concurrent chemoradiation regimen combines 70 Gy delivered in 2-Gy fractions over 7 weeks with single-agent cisplatin (100 mg/m2) on days 1, 22, and 43 of the radiation schedule. Chemotherapy in combination with altered frac- tionation radiotherapy is being investigated in clinical trials. Caution must be used for elderly patients particularly over 70 years of age as non-cancer-related morbidity and mortal- ity may outweigh the benefit of the addition of chemother- apy (see additional reference below).
No published randomized clinical trials have compared concurrent chemotherapy and radiation versus altered frac- tionation radiation schedules in patients with stages III and IV HNSCC. It should be noted that patients with oral cav- ity carcinomas make up a minority of the studied popula- tion of HNSCC patients managed with either approach. Both treatment approaches may be considered for individ- ual patients with locally advanced carcinoma of the oral cavity, particularly those who are not candidates for surgery. However, chemoradiation is preferable for patients with advanced nodal disease. Both treatment strategies are asso- ciated with increased side effects.
Combined Surgery and Radiotherapy. Combined sur- gery and radiotherapy may improve local-regional control for patients who are candidates for both treatments. Planned combined therapy requires a coordinated multidisciplinary approach between the surgeon and the radiation oncologist.
An example of planned combined therapy is the integration of neck dissection postradiotherapy for lymph nodes greater than 3 cm when the primary lesion is treated with radia- tion. Lymph nodes larger than 3 cm are suboptimally treated with radiotherapy alone.
Adjuvant Radiotherapy. Patients treated with primary surgery may require postoperative radiotherapy. Adjuvant radiotherapy is recommended based on operative or patho- logic findings of the surgically removed primary lesion or regional lymph nodes. Postoperative radiotherapy is indi- cated for positive or close surgical resection margins, mul- tiple positive lymph nodes, or extracapsular lymph node extension. Postoperative radiotherapy is also considered for intraoperative tumor rupture or cut-through, intraoperative revision of initially positive margins, presence of perineural invasion, presence of lymphatic or vascular involvement, and preoperative incisional biopsy of the neck. Patients with large nodes (.3 cm) and advanced primary lesions with cortical bone, skin, or muscle involvement may be managed with planned combined therapy (see section on combined surgery and radiotherapy). Preoperative radio- therapy indications are similar to those for postoperative radiotherapy.
Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Combination with Radio- therapy. Two collaborative groups have reported important results of large phase III trials investigating the addition of concurrent cisplatin to postoperative radiotherapy. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Can- cer (EORTC) radiotherapy group randomized high-risk HNSCC patients to receive a postoperative radiation dose of 6600 cGy in 6.5 weeks alone or radiation plus three cycles of concurrent cisplatin (100 mg/m2). Estimated 5-year disease-free survival (36% vs. 47%) and overall survival (40% vs. 53%) favored the combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy arm. The RTOG/Intergroup conducted a sim- ilar trial in high-risk patients. Improvement in the estimated 2-year local-regional control (72% vs. 82%) favored chemo- radiation. Disease-free survival was prolonged, but not over- all survival with chemoradiation.
Molecular Targeted Agents in Combination with Radia- tion. The strategy of combining radiation with molecular targeted agents is an area of active preclinical and clinical research. These agents are typically antibodies or small mol- ecules that modulate important signal transduction path- ways. Molecular targeted agents are usually cytostatic on their own but may enhance the radiation response in tu- mors. The ideal molecular targeted agent enhances radia- tion response but does not increase radiation side effects that are already at or near clinically acceptable tolerance levels. An example of an important radiation response signaling pathway is the EGFR pathway. Cetuximab, an anti-EGFR antibody, in combination with radiation for HNSCC, has been reported to improve local-regional con- trol and survival compared with radiation alone, without significantly increasing acute mucosal toxicity.
Palliative Radiotherapy. Patients who are not candidates for curative therapies because of very advanced incurable

Ulcerative Conditions
cancers, significant comorbid illnesses, or refusal of surgery may be candidates for palliative radiotherapy. The objective of palliative treatment should be to alleviate symptoms such as pain or bleeding. Particular attention should be paid to limiting morbidity from treatment.
Therapeutic Radiation Complications. Along with the therapeutic effects of radiation are dose-dependent side ef- fects (Box 2-15). Some of these are reversible, whereas others are not (Figures 2-87 to 2-90). Radiation-induced mucosi- tis and ulcers and the accompanying pain, xerostomia, loss of taste, and dysgeusia are common side effects. Radia- tion mucositis is a reversible condition that begins 1 to 2 weeks after the start of therapy and ends several weeks after termination of therapy. Oral candidiasis often accom- panies the mucositis. Use of antifungals, chlorhexidine rinses, or salt-soda rinses helps reduce morbidity.
Permanent damage to salivary gland tissue situated in the beam path may produce significant levels of xerostomia. Some recovery is often noted, especially at lower radiation levels. Xerostomia is frequently a patient’s chief complaint

during the postradiation period. Frequent use of water or artificial saliva is of minimal benefit to these patients. Pilo- carpine, used during the course of radiation, may provide some protective measure of salivary function. With the dry- ness also comes the potential for the development of cervi- cal, or so-called radiation, caries. This problem can be minimized with regular follow-up dental care and scrupu- lous oral hygiene. Custom-fitted soft trays are made for the fully or partially dentate patient to permit the nightly ap- plication of neutral pH fluoride directly to the teeth. This treatment is initiated at the start of cancer treatment and continues for the remainder of the patient’s life. It has been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of cervical caries and thereby the need for future dental extractions.
Skin in the path of the radiation beam also suffers some damage. Alopecia is temporary at lower radiation levels but permanent at the higher levels required in the treatment of SCC. Skin erythema is temporary, but the telangiectasias and atrophy that follow are permanent. Cutaneous pigmen- tation in the line of therapy is also a late complication, and it, too, may be permanent.
A more insidious problem lies in the damage that radia- tion causes to bone, which may result in osteonecrosis (Figures 2-91 and 2-92). Radiation apparently has deleterious

effects on osteocytes, osteoblasts, and endothelial cells, caus- ing reduced capacity of bone to recover from injury. Injury may come in the form of trauma (such as extractions), ad- vancing periodontal disease, and periapical inflammation associated with nonvital teeth. Once osteonecrosis occurs, varying amounts of bone (usually in the mandible) are lost. This may be an area as small as a few millimeters to as large as half the jaw or more. The most important factor
responsible for osteonecrosis is the amount of radiation di- rected through bone on the path to the tumor. Oral health is also of considerable significance. Poor nutrition and chronic alcoholism appear to be influential in the progres- sion of this complication. Conservative surgical removal of necrotic bone may assist in the healing process. Also, if avail- able, the use of a hyperbaric oxygen chamber may provide patients with a healing advantage.
Because osteonecrosis is a danger that is always present after radiation, tooth extractions should be avoided after therapy. If absolutely necessary, tooth removal should be performed as atraumatically as possible, using antibiotic coverage. It is preferable to commit to a treatment plan that schedules tooth removal before radiation therapy begins. Initial soft tissue healing before therapy begins reduces the risk of nonhealing at the extraction sites. Prosthetic devices such as dentures and partial dentures, if carefully con- structed and monitored, can be worn without difficulty. Xerostomia does not seem to cause difficulty in the wearing of these prostheses. Continued careful surveillance of the patient’s oral health, during and after radiation therapy, helps keep complications to an acceptable minimum.
Prognosis. Similar to other cancers, the prognosis for patients with oral SCC is dependent on both the histologic subtype (grade) and the clinical extent (stage) of the tumor. Of the two, the clinical stage is significantly more impor- tant. Other more abstract factors that may influence the clinical course include the patient’s age, gender, general health, immune system status, and mental attitude.
Grading of a tumor is the microscopic determination of the level of differentiation of tumor cells. Well-differentiated lesions generally have a less aggressive biological course than poorly differentiated lesions. Of all SCC histologic subtypes, the best-differentiated lesion, verrucous carcinoma, has the most favorable prognosis. Less-differentiated lesions have a correspondingly poorer prognosis. In addition, factors such as depth and pattern of invasion and lymphovascular and perineural involvement appear to provide important prog- nostic information that may affect treatment selection.
The most important indicator of prognosis is the clinical stage of the disease. Once metastasis to cervical nodes has

72 CHAPTER 2
Ulcerative Conditions
occurred, the 5-year survival rate is reduced by approxi- mately half. The overall 5-year survival rate for oral SCC ranges from 45% to 50%. If the neoplasm is small and lo- calized, the 5-year cure rate may be as high as 60% to 70% (lower lip lesions may rate as high as 90%). However, if cervical metastases are present at the time of diagnosis, the survival figures drop precipitously to about 25%.
The TNM system mentioned earlier for the clinical stag- ing of oral SCC was devised to provide clinical uniformity. T is a measure of the primary tumor size, N is an estimation of regional lymph node metastasis, and M is a determina- tion of distant metastases (Box 2-16; Figure 2-93). Use of

this system allows more meaningful comparison of data from different institutions and helps guide therapeutic deci- sions. As the clinical stage advances from I to IV, the prog- nosis worsens (Table 2-6).
Another factor that comes into play in the overall prog- nosis of oral cancer is increased risk for development of a second primary lesion. The risk of a second primary lesion in the head and neck region or upper airways is about 5% per year for the first 7 years following the initial tumor. The mechanism for this finding is not entirely known. It was thought for several decades that the mucosa lining the entire mouth and the upper aerodigestive tract was exposed to similar carcinogens from tobacco and alcohol and was in effect “condemned mucosa.” This so-called field canceriza- tion theory was used to explain the relatively high incidence of new primary tumors in patients who had oral or oropha- ryngeal cancer. Recently, cancerization theory has been called into question with the finding that many second primary lesions, including some at unusual anatomic sites in the head and neck and lungs of patients with a history of oral cancer, are genetically very similar, if not identical, to the original tumor. This suggests that these second tumors may not represent a new malignancy, but rather, a metasta- sis or recurrence of the original tumor elsewhere. Because many of the second tumors develop in sites not normally connected anatomically to the primary tumor by known lymphatic pathways, it has been proposed that intraepithe- lial migration of malignant cells may occur. It is not yet clear which scenario is correct, or if indeed both mecha- nisms occur in different settings. It is perhaps more likely that in some patients secondary lesions do represent new primary tumors, but in others the secondary tumors may represent recurrent or metastatic disease.

 TNM Clinical Staging of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma
   Carcinoma of the Maxillary Sinus
Etiology
Malignancies of the paranasal sinuses occur most com- monly in the maxillary sinus. The cause is unknown, al- though squamous metaplasia of sinus epithelium associated with chronic sinusitis and oral antral fistulas is believed by some investigators to be a predisposing factor.
Clinical Features
This is a disease of older age, predominantly affecting pa- tients older than age 40. Men are generally afflicted more than women. Past history in these patients frequently in- cludes symptoms of sinusitis. As the neoplasm progresses, a dull ache in the area occurs, with progressive development of overt pain. Specific signs and symptoms referable to oral structures are common, especially when the neoplasm has its origin in the sinus floor. As the neoplasm extends toward the apices of the maxillary posterior teeth, referred pain may occur. Toothache, which actually represents neoplastic involvement of the superior alveolar nerve, is not an un- common symptom in patients with maxillary sinus malig- nancies. In ruling out dental disease by history and clinical tests, it is imperative that the dental practitioner be aware that sinus neoplasms may present through the alveolus. Without this suspicion, unfortunate delays in definitive treatment may occur. Other clinical signs of invasion of the alveolar process include recently acquired malocclusion, displacement of teeth, and vertical mobility of teeth (teeth undermined by neoplasm). Failure of a socket to heal after an extraction may be indicative of tumor involvement. Par- esthesia should always be viewed as an ominous sign and should cause the clinician to consider intraosseous malig- nancy. Occasional maxillary sinus cancers may present as a palatal ulcer and mass representing extension through the bone and soft tissue of the palate (Figures 2-94 and 2-95).
Histopathology
Of malignancies that originate in the maxillary sinus, squa- mous cell carcinoma is the most common histologic type.
• Figure 2-94 Carcinoma of the maxillary sinus presenting through the palate.
• Figure 2-95 Carcinoma of the maxillary sinus producing ill-defined maxillary radiolucency.
These lesions are generally less differentiated than those oc- curring in oral mucous membranes. Infrequently, adenocar- cinomas arising presumably from mucous glands in the sinus lining may be seen.
Diagnosis
From a clinical standpoint, when oral signs and symptoms appear to be related to antral carcinoma, a dental origin must be ruled out. This is best accomplished by the dental practitioner because of familiarity with healthy tooth-jaw relationships and experience in interpretation of vitality tests. Other clinical considerations related to malignancies in the age group in which antral carcinomas occur are metastatic disease and plasma cell myeloma. Osteosar- coma and other, less common sarcomas that are usually found in a younger age group might be included. Palatal involvement should also cause the clinician to consider adenocarcinoma of minor salivary gland origin, lym- phoma, and SCC.
Treatment and Prognosis
Maxillary sinus carcinomas are generally treated with sur- gery or radiation or both. A combination of the two seems
  73

   AB
to be somewhat more effective than either modality alone. Radiation is often completed first, with surgical resection following. Chemotherapy used in conjunction with radia- tion has been somewhat successful.
In any event, the prognosis is only fair at best. Cure is directly dependent on the clinical stage of the disease at the time of initial treatment. Compared with oral lesions, sinus lesions are discovered at a more advanced stage because of delays in seeking treatment and delays in making a defini- tive diagnosis. The anatomy of the area also influences the prognosis. The 5-year survival rate is about 25%. If the disease is discovered early, the likelihood of survival increases.
Basal Cell Carcinoma of the Skin
Basal cell carcinoma is the most prevalent cancer of the skin as well as of the head and neck. The lesion is most often encountered in older patients on non–hair bearing skin. Men are more commonly affected than women, presumably because of greater cumulative sun exposure. This malig- nancy arises from basal cells of the skin. A vast majority of basal cell carcinomas occur on sun-exposed skin. Except in very rare instances, basal cell carcinoma does not occur on mucous membranes.
Individuals at increased risk for the development of basal cell carcinoma are those with lighter natural skin pigmenta- tion, those with a long history of chronic sun exposure, and those with one of several predisposing hereditary syn- dromes. Among the latter is nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, in which individuals have multiple odontogenic keratocysts, skeletal abnormalities, and numerous basal cell carcinomas.
Clinical Features
Basal cell carcinoma presents as an indurated pearly papule or nodule with telangiectatic vessels coursing over its sur- face (Figures 2-96 and 2-97). With time, the center of the tumor becomes ulcerated and crusted. If untreated, the tu- mor exhibits a slow but relentless locally destructive nature. Other clinical forms may be seen on occasion. The pig- mented form of basal cell carcinoma presents in a manner
• Figure 2-97 Basal cell carcinoma.
similar to that of the noduloulcerative type, with the addi- tion of melanin pigmentation within or at the periphery. The superficial form presents as a scaly erythematous lesion flush with the skin surface, occasionally appearing as an atrophic scar–like process. The fibrosing form of basal cell carcinoma presents as an indurated yellowish plaque that may be slightly depressed or flat, resembling a slow or in- sidiously enlarging scar in the absence of trauma. Because basal cell carcinomas are generally slow growing and are rarely metastatic, the prognosis is very good.
Histopathology
In basal cell carcinoma, nests and cords of cuboidal cells arise from the region of the epidermal basal cells (Figure 2-98). Neoplastic cells around the periphery of the invading nests and strands are usually palisaded and often columnar. In some infiltrative basal cell carcinomas, tiny infiltrative nests are found in a fibroblastic stroma. This has been described as an aggressive growth pattern and may portend a more ag- gressive clinical course.
Treatment
Various surgical procedures (standard scalpel surgery, cryosurgery, electrosurgery, Mohs’ microscopically guided surgery) and irradiation can be used to treat basal cell

carcinoma. The type of treatment depends on the size and location of the neoplasm, as well as the experience and training of the clinician. Since alterations in Hedgehog signaling are implicated in the pathogenesis of many basal-cell carcinoma, inhibitors of this pathway such as the small molecule vismodegib have shown promise in patients with advanced disease.
Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Skin
In the vast majority of cases, squamous cell carcinoma of the face and lower lip arises from epidermal keratinocytes that have been damaged by sunlight. Unlike basal cell car- cinoma, this neoplasm has significant potential to metasta- size to regional lymph nodes and beyond. As with basal cell carcinoma, several factors contribute to the etiology of SCC; however, the chief factor remains repeated and chronic damage caused by sunlight. The highest incidence is noted in fair-skinned individuals after long-term expo- sure to sunlight. In addition, carcinogens such as tars, oils, and arsenicals; exposure to x-rays; and the presence of skin diseases that cause scarring, such as severe burns and discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE), predispose to malignant trans- formation of the epithelium.
Clinical Features
The clinical course is insidious, evolving over months to years. A central ulcer with slightly raised indurated margins and surrounding erythema eventually forms. Lesions may occasionally appear as verrucous growths, papules, or plaques. Areas of the face most commonly affected include the lower lip, tip of the ear, forehead, and infraorbital/nasal bridge region (Figure 2-99). Lesions are firm and indurated, reflecting tumor infiltration of adjacent tissues.
Lesions that arise within actinic keratoses are less aggres- sive than those arising de novo or in some sun-protected loca- tions. Squamous cell carcinomas arising at sites of irradiation, burns, or chronic degenerative skin disorders are more aggressive than their sun-exposure counterparts. A squamous cell carcinoma arising in solar cheilitis tends to invade and metastasize at an earlier point than its counterpart in
• Figure 2-99 Squamous cell carcinoma. sun-damaged skin. Intraoral squamous cell carcinomas are far
more aggressive than cutaneous tumors.
Histopathology
This tumor consists of atypical keratinocytes that invade the dermis and beyond. As with intraoral squamous cell carcinoma, cytologic features include an increased nuclear- cytoplasmic ratio, nuclear hyperchromatism, individual cell keratinization, tumor giant cells, atypical mitotic figures, and an increased mitotic rate.
Treatment
The mainstay of therapy remains excision. The mode of excision, however, depends on the size and location of the lesion. Larger carcinomas may be treated with wide exci- sion, often with reconstructive grafts, or irradiation therapy. Microscopically directed surgery (Mohs’ surgery) may be used because of its advantage in tissue conservation. Non- surgical options, such as chemotherapy and radiation ther- apy, are occasionally used to treat patients under special circumstances. The overall 5-year cure rate for squamous cell carcinoma of the skin is approximately 90%.

   Lesions of the oral mucosa that appear clinically white re- sult from the scattering of light through a thickened layer of keratin, epithelial hyperplasia, intracellular epithelial edema, and/or reduced vascularity of subjacent connective tissue. White or yellow-white lesions may also be due to fibrinous exudate covering an ulcer, submucosal deposits, surface debris, or fungal colonies.
Hereditary Conditions
Leukoedema
Leukoedema is a generalized mild opacification of the buc- cal mucosa that is common enough to be regarded as a variation of normal. It can be identified in a large propor- tion of the population.
Etiology and Pathogenesis
To date, the cause of leukoedema has not been established. Factors such as smoking, chewing tobacco, alcohol ingestion, bacterial infection, salivary conditions, electrochemical inter- actions, and a possible association with cannabis use have been implicated, but none are specifically proven causes.
Clinical Features
Leukoedema is usually discovered as an incidental finding. It is asymptomatic and symmetrically distributed in the buccal mucosa, and to a lesser extent over the labial mucosa. It appears as a gray-white, diffuse, filmy, or milky surface alteration (Figure 3-1). In exaggerated cases, a whitish cast with surface textural changes, including wrinkling or cor- rugation, may be seen. With stretching of the buccal mu- cosa, the opaque changes dissipate. It is more apparent in nonwhites, especially African Americans.
Histopathology
In leukoedema, the epithelium is parakeratotic and acan- thotic, with marked intracellular edema of spinous cells. The enlarged epithelial cells have small, pyknotic (condensed) nuclei in optically clear cytoplasm.
Differential Diagnosis
White sponge nevus, hereditary benign intraepithelial dyskeratosis, the response to chronic cheek biting, and li- chen planus all may show clinical similarities to leukoedema. Microscopic features can differentiate these lesions.
Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment is not necessary because the changes are innocu- ous and no malignant potential exists. If the diagnosis is in doubt, a biopsy should be performed.

White Sponge Nevus: Key Features
  • Figure 3-1 Leukoedema. A thin ‘milky’ white coloration of the buccal mucosa. Note that the patient also has gingivitis.
White Sponge Nevus (Cannon’s disease)
White sponge nevus (WSN) is an autosomal-dominant inher- ited condition that is due to point mutations for genes coding for keratin 4 and/or 13. It affects oral mucosa bilaterally and symmetrically, and treatment is generally not required.
Clinical Features
WSN presents as an asymptomatic, folded, white lesion that may affect several mucosal sites (Figure 3-2; Box 3-1). Lesions tend to be thickened and have a spongy consistency. The pre- sentation intraorally is almost always bilateral and symmetric and usually appears early in life, typically before puberty. The characteristic clinical manifestations of this particular form of keratosis are usually best observed on the buccal mucosa, al- though other areas such as the tongue and vestibular mucosa may also be involved. The conjunctival mucosa is usually spared, but mucosa of the esophagus, anus, vulva, and vagina may be affected. Skin is not affected because, unlike mucosa, skin does not contain keratins 4 and 13.
Histopathology
Microscopically, the epithelium is greatly thickened, with marked spongiosis, acanthosis, and parakeratosis (Figure 3-3). Within the stratum spinosum, marked hydropic or clear cell change may be noted, often beginning in the parabasal region
Asymptomatic
Bilateral folded/shaggy white buccal mucosal change Hereditary; appears early in life

and extending very close to the surface. Perinuclear eosinophilic condensation of cytoplasm is characteristic of prickle cells in WSN. It is often possible to see columns of parakeratin extend- ing from the spinous layer to the surface.
Differential Diagnosis
The differential diagnosis includes hereditary benign epithe- lial dyskeratosis, lichen planus, lichenoid drug reaction, lupus erythematosus (LE), cheek chewing, and possibly candidiasis (Table 3-1). Once tissue diagnosis is confirmed, no additional biopsies are necessary.
Treatment
No treatment is necessary for this condition because it is asymptomatic and benign.
Hereditary Benign Intraepithelial Dyskeratosis
Etiology
Hereditary benign intraepithelial dyskeratosis (HBID), also known as Witkop disease or Witkop-von Sallmann syn- drome, is a rare, hereditary condition (autosomal domi- nant). It was noted within a tri-racial isolate of white, Indian, and African American composition in Halifax County, North Carolina. The initial cohort of 75 patients was traced to a single common female ancestor who lived nearly 130 years earlier. With the use of genetic linkage and molecular analyses in two large families affected by HBID, one group localized the candidate causative genetic region to a telomeric region of chromosome 4q35, where three alleles for two linked markers exist. Using a next generation sequencing approach, a novel missense mutation M77T

Bilateral Buccal Mucosal White Lesions: Differential Diagnosis
In some patients ocular lesions may vary seasonally, with spontaneous shedding of conjunctival plaques. Patients may complain of photophobia, especially in early life. Blindness, resulting from corneal vascularization, has been reported.
Histopathology
Similarities between oral and conjunctival lesions are noted microscopically. Epithelial hyperplasia and acanthosis are present with intracellular edema. Enlarged hyaline keratino- cytes are the dyskeratotic elements that are present in the su- perficial half of the epithelium. Normal cellular features are noted within the lower spinous and basal layers. Inflammatory cell infiltration within the lamina propria is minimal, and the epithelium–connective tissue junction is well defined.
Treatment
No treatment is necessary because this condition is self- limiting and benign. It appears to pose no risk of malignant transformation. Genetic counseling may be sought.
Follicular Keratosis (Darier’s disease)
Etiology and Pathogenesis
Follicular keratosis (Darier’s disease, Darier-White disease) is an autosomal-dominant disorder that results in desmo- somal defects and dysfunction by way of altered epithelial cell adhesion. Many cases appear sporadically as new muta- tions. Screening of candidate genes has led to the discovery that mutations in ATP2A2 on chromosome 12q23-24, a gene that encodes the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium–adenosine triphosphatase (Ca21-ATPase) isoform 2, cause this condition. It has been proposed that abnormali- ties in this calcium pump function interfere with cell growth and differentiation of calcium-dependent processes.
Clinical Features
Onset occurs between the ages of 6 and 20 years. The disease has a predilection for the skin, with 13% of patients demonstrating oral lesions. Skin manifestations are characterized by small, skin- colored papular lesions, symmetrically distributed over the face, trunk, and intertriginous areas. The papules eventually coalesce and feel greasy because of excessive keratin production. The
   was discovered of the gene NLRP1 on chromosome 17p13.2, and has also been reported in a family with the disease. Despite these findings the precise gene that causes the condition has yet to be confirmed.
Clinical Features
HBID presentation includes early onset (usually within the first year of life) of bulbar conjunctivitis, conjunctival plaques at the corneal limbus, and oral white lesions. Preceding the bulbar conjunctivitis are foamy gelatinous plaques that repre- sent the ocular counterpart of the oral mucosal lesions.
Oral lesions consist of soft, asymptomatic, white folds and plaques of spongy mucosa. Areas characteristically involved in- clude the buccal and labial mucosa and the labial commissures, as well as the floor of the mouth and lateral surfaces of the tongue, gingiva, and palate. The dorsum of the tongue is usually spared. Oral lesions are generally detected within the first year of life, with a gradual increase in extent until midadolescence.

coalesced areas subsequently form patches ranging from vegetat- ing to verrucous growths that have a tendency to become in- fected and malodorous. Lesions may also occur unilaterally or in a zosteriform pattern (lesions follow a dermatome). Thickening of the palms and soles (hyperkeratosis palmaris et plantaris) by excessive keratotic tissue is not uncommon. Fingernail changes may include fragility, splintering, and subungual keratosis. Nail changes are often helpful in establishing a diagnosis.
The extent of the oral lesions may parallel the extent of skin involvement. Favored oral mucosal sites include the attached gingiva and hard palate. Lesions typically appear as small, whitish papules, producing an overall cobblestone appearance. Papules range from 2 to 3 mm in diameter and may become coalescent. Extension beyond the oral cavity into the oropharynx and pharynx may occur.
Histopathology
Oral lesions closely resemble cutaneous lesions. Features include: (1) formation of suprabasal lacunae (clefts) containing acantho- lytic epithelial cells, (2) basal layer proliferation immediately be- low and adjacent to the lacunae or clefts, (3) formation of verti- cal clefts that show a lining of parakeratotic and dyskeratotic cells, and (4) the presence of specific benign dyskeratotic cells, called corps ronds and grains. Corps ronds are large, keratinized squamous cells with round, uniformly basophilic nuclei and in- tensely eosinophilic cytoplasm. Grains are smaller parakeratotic cells with pyknotic, hyperchromatic nuclei.
Treatment and Prognosis
The goal of treatment is to improve the appearance of the skin lesions, reduce symptoms, and prevent or treat infective complications. Topical corticosteroids and the vitamin A analog retinoic acid have been used effectively, but long-term therapy is tolerated poorly. The disease is chronic and slowly progressive; remissions may be noted in some patients.
Reactive Lesions
Focal (Frictional) Hyperkeratosis
Etiology
Focal (frictional) hyperkeratosis is a white lesion that is related to chronic rubbing or friction against an oral mu- cosal surface. This results in a hyperkeratotic white lesion that is analogous to a callus on the skin.
Clinical Features
Friction-induced hyperkeratoses occur in areas that are commonly traumatized, such as the lips, lateral margins of the tongue, buccal mucosa along the occlusal line, and edentulous alveolar ridges (Figures 3-4 to 3-7; Box 3-2). Chronic cheek or lip chewing may result in opacification (keratinization) of the affected area. Chewing on edentu- lous alveolar ridges produces the same effect.
Histopathology
As the name indicates, the primary microscopic change is hyperkeratosis (Figure 3-8). A few chronic inflammatory cells may be seen in the subjacent connective tissue.

• Figure 3-5 Focal hyperkeratosis caused by chronic rubbing of the lip against teeth.

• Figure 3-8 Focal hyperkeratosis biopsy specimen. Note that the epithelial maturation pattern is otherwise normal.
Diagnosis
Careful history taking and examination should indicate the nature of this lesion. Patients should be advised to dis- continue the causative habit, or the offending tooth or denture should be smoothed. The lesion should resolve, or at least should be reduced in intensity, over time, helping to confirm the clinical diagnosis. Resolution of the lesion would allow unmasking of any underlying lesion that may not be related to trauma (Table 3-2). If the clinical diagno- sis is in doubt, a biopsy should be taken.
Treatment
As long as the diagnosis is not in doubt, observation is generally all that is required for simple frictional hyper- keratotic lesions. Control of the habit causing the lesion should result in clinical improvement. No malignant potential exists.
White Lesions Associated with Smokeless Tobacco
Marked geographic and gender differences in tobacco use have been identified. In the United States a relatively high prevalence of smokeless tobacco users are found in the southern and western states. Use by men in New York and Rhode Island is less than 1% of the population, but in West Virginia, use exceeds 20%. Among teenagers, white males are the predominant users of smokeless tobacco in this
Solitary White Lesion: Differential Diagnosis
     group. Smokeless tobacco is also used in Sweden in the form of snus, a nonfermented type of moist tobacco with lower concentrations of harmful nicotine and tobacco de- rivatives versus those types of fermented smokeless tobaccos traditionally used in the United States. In regions such as the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, use of smoke- less tobacco is even more common and more carcinogenic whereas the tobacco-containing preparations generally are of a higher (alkaline) pH and are often mixed with other ingredients, including shredded areca (betel) nut, lime, camphor, and spices.
The general increase in smokeless tobacco consumption has been related to peer pressure and increased media adver- tising, which often glamorizes the use of smokeless tobacco, or snuff dipping. In addition, individuals who have been intense smokers and those who wish to avoid smoking may gravitate to this alternative. The clinical results of long-term exposure to smokeless tobacco include the development of oral mucosal white patches with a slightly increased malig- nant potential, dependence, alterations of taste, acceleration of periodontal disease, and significant amounts of dental abrasion.
Etiology
A causal relationship has been documented between smoke- less tobacco and white tissue changes. Although all forms of smokeless tobacco may cause alterations in the oral mucosa, snuff (particulate, finely divided, or shredded tobacco) ap- pears to be more likely to cause oral lesions than does chew- ing tobacco. Oral mucosa responds to the topically induced effects of tobacco with inflammation and keratosis. At the molecular level, altered cell signaling in damaged cells has been demonstrated. Dysplastic changes may follow, but with a low potential risk of malignant change. Smokeless tobacco–induced alterations in tissues are thought to be a response to tobacco constituents and perhaps other agents

that are added for flavoring or moisture retention. Carcino- gens such as N-nitrosonornicotine, an organic component of chewing tobacco and snuff, have been identified in smokeless tobacco. The pH of snuff, which ranges between 8.2 and 9.3, may be another factor that contributes to the alteration of mucosa.
Duration of exposure to smokeless tobacco that is neces- sary to produce mucosal damage is measured in terms of years. It has been demonstrated that leukoplakia can be predicted with the use of three tins of tobacco per week or duration of the habit of longer than 2 years.
Clinical Features
White lesions associated with smokeless tobacco develop in the immediate area where the tobacco is habitually placed (Figures 3-9 and 3-10; Box 3-3). The most common area of involvement is the mucobuccal fold of the mandible in the incisor or the molar region. The mucosa develops a granular to wrinkled hyperkeratotic appearance. In advanced cases, a heavy, folded character may be seen. Less often, an erythro- plakic or red component may be admixed with the white keratotic component. The lesions are generally painless and asymptomatic, and their discovery is often incidental to routine oral examination.

(decades)
Histopathology
Slight to moderate parakeratosis, often in the form of spires or chevrons, is noted over the surface of the affected mucosa (Figure 3-11). Superficial epithelium may demonstrate vacuolization or edema. A slight to moderate chronic in- flammatory cell infiltrate is typically present. Epithelial dysplasia may occasionally develop in these lesions, espe- cially among long-time users of smokeless tobacco. On oc- casion, a diffuse zone of basophilic stromal alteration may be seen, usually adjacent to inflamed minor salivary glands.
Treatment and Prognosis
With discontinuation of smokeless tobacco use, some lesions may disappear after several weeks. It would be prudent to perform a biopsy on persistent lesions. A long period of exposure to smokeless tobacco increases the risk of transformation to verrucous or squamous cell carcinoma, although this risk is probably low.

Nicotine Stomatitis
Etiology
Nicotine stomatitis is a common tobacco-related form of keratosis. It is typically associated with pipe and cigar smok- ing, with a positive correlation between intensity of smoking and severity of the condition. The importance of the direct topical effect of smoke can be appreciated in instances in which the hard palate is covered by a removable prosthesis, resulting in sparing of the mucosa beneath the appliance and hyperkeratosis of exposed areas. The combination of tobacco carcinogens and heat is markedly intensified in reverse smok- ing (lit end positioned inside the mouth), adding significant risk for malignant transformation (see Figure 3-13).
Clinical Features
The palatal mucosa initially responds with an erythematous change followed by keratinization (Box 3-4). Subsequent to opacification or keratinization of the palate, red dots sur- rounded by white keratotic rings appear (Figures 3-12 and 3-13). The dots represent inflammation surrounding the minor salivary gland excretory ducts.
Etiology
Caused by pipe, cigar, and cigarette smoking
Opacification of the palate caused by heat and carcinogens Most severe changes seen in patients who “reverse smoke”
Clinical Features
Generalized white change (hyperkeratosis) seen in hard palate Red dots in the palate represent inflamed salivary duct orifices

• Figure 3-12 Nicotine stomatitis.

Histopathology
Nicotine stomatitis is characterized by epithelial hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis (Figure 3-14). The minor salivary glands in the area show inflammatory change, and excretory ducts may show squamous metaplasia.
Treatment and Prognosis
This condition rarely evolves into malignancy, except in indi- viduals who reverse smoke. Although the risk of carcinoma
 • BOX 3-4

  • Figure 3-14 Nicotine stomatitis biopsy specimen showing salivary duct metaplasia and inflammation.
  
www.konkur.in
development in the palate is minimal, nicotine stomatitis is a marker or indicator of intense tobacco use and hence may indicate increased risk of epithelial dysplasia and neoplasia elsewhere in the oral cavity, oropharynx, and respiratory tract. Therefore, nicotine stomatitis should be viewed as an indicator of potential significant epithelial change at sites other than the hard palate.
Hairy Leukoplakia
Etiology and Pathogenesis
In 1984, an unusual white lesion along the lateral margins of the tongue, predominantly in gay men, was first described. Evidence indicates that this particular form of leukoplakia, known as hairy leukoplakia, represents an opportunistic infection that is related to the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and is found mainly in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–infected individuals. In a small percentage of cases, hairy leukoplakia may be seen in patients with other forms of immunosuppression, particu- larly those associated with organ transplantation (medical- induced immunosuppression), hematologic malignancy, and long-term use of systemic or topical corticosteroids.
The prevalence of hairy leukoplakia in HIV-infected patients has been declining as a result of new chemothera- peutic regimens for HIV. Of importance is that this lesion has been associated with subsequent or concomitant devel- opment of clinical and laboratory features of acquired im- munodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in as many as 80% of untreated patients. A positive correlation with depletion of peripheral CD4 cells and with the presence of hairy leuko- plakia has been noted. Several other oral conditions have been described as having greater than expected frequency in patients with AIDS (Box 3-5).
The presence of EBV in hairy leukoplakia, as well as in the normal epithelium of patients with AIDS, has been confirmed. Through the use of molecular methods such as in situ hybridization and ultrastructural analysis, viral par- ticles have been localized within the nuclei and cytoplasm of the oral epithelial cells of hairy leukoplakia. Studies further indicate that this particular virus replicates within the oral hairy leukoplakia lesion. It is not understood why the lateral surface of the tongue is the favored site.

Clinical Features
Hairy leukoplakia presents as a well-demarcated white le- sion that varies in architecture from a flat and plaquelike to a papillary/filiform, or a corrugated lesion (Figures 3-15 and 3-16; Box 3-6). It may be unilateral or bilateral. A vast majority of cases have been located along the lateral margins of the tongue, with occasional extension onto the dorsal surface. Rarely, hairy leukoplakia may be seen on the buccal mucosa, the floor of the mouth, or the palate. Lesions have not been seen in the vaginal or anal mucosa.
In general, no associated symptoms have been reported, although associated infection with Candida albicans might call attention to the presence of this condition. In more severe cases, the patient may become visually aware of the lesion.
Histopathology
The characteristic microscopic feature of hairy leukoplakia is found in the nuclei of upper level keratinocytes (Figure 3-17). Viral inclusions and/or peripheral displacement of chromatin with a resultant smudgy nucleus are evident. This is seen in the context of a markedly hyperparakeratotic surface, often

with the formation of keratotic surface irregularities and ridges. C. albicans hyphae are often seen extending into the superficial epithelial cell layers. Beneath the surface, within the spinous cell layer, cells show ballooning degeneration and perinuclear clearing. A general paucity of subepithelial inflam- matory cells has been noted, and Langerhans cells are scant.
In situ hybridization studies have demonstrated the pres- ence of EBV within cells, showing nuclear inclusions and basophilic homogenization. Further confirmation has been accomplished by ultrastructural demonstration of intranu- clear virions of EBV.
Differential Diagnosis
The clinical differential diagnosis of hairy leukoplakia in- cludes idiopathic leukoplakia, frictional hyperkeratosis (tongue chewing), and leukoplakia associated with tobacco use. Other entities that might be considered are lichen pla- nus, lupus erythematosus, and hyperplastic candidiasis.
Treatment and Prognosis
No specific treatment is available for hairy leukoplakia. For pa- tients whose immune status is unknown and in whom biopsy findings indicate hairy leukoplakia, investigation for HIV infec- tion or other causes of systemic or local immunosuppression should be undertaken. While traditionally HIV infection was the most common cause of immunosuppression that led to hairy leukoplakia, increasingly other systemic and local causes of immunosuppressive states are now seen as important..
For cosmetic reasons, patients may request treatment of their lesions. Responses to acyclovir, ganciclovir, famciclo- vir, tretinoin, and podophyllum have been reported, with

Hairy Tongue (Black hairy tongue)
Hairy tongue is a clinical term referring to a condition of filiform papillary overgrowth on the dorsal surface of the tongue of variable color.
Etiology
Numerous initiating or predisposing factors for hairy tongue have been identified. Broad-spectrum antibiotics and sys- temic corticosteroids are often identified in the clinical his- tory of patients with this condition. In addition, oxygenating mouth rinses containing hydrogen peroxide, sodium perbo- rate, and carbamide peroxide have been cited as possible etio- logic agents in this condition. Hairy tongue may also be seen in individuals who are heavy smokers, in those who have undergone radiotherapy to the head and neck region for malignant disease, and in patients who have undergone he- matopoietic stem cell transplantation. The basic problem is believed to be related to an alteration in microbial flora, with attendant proliferation of fungi and chromogenic bacteria, along with papillary overgrowth.
Clinical Features
The clinical alteration translates to asymptomatic hyperpla- sia of the filiform papillae, with concomitant retardation of the normal rate of desquamation. The result is a thick, mat- ted surface that serves to trap bacteria, fungi, cellular debris, and foreign material (Figure 3-18; Box 3-7).
Hairy tongue is predominantly a cosmetic problem be- cause symptoms are generally minimal. However, when extensive elongation of the papillae occurs, a gagging or a tickling sensation may be felt. The color may range from white to tan to deep brown or black, depending on diet, oral hygiene, oral medications, and the composition of the bacteria inhabiting the papillary surface.
Histopathology
Microscopic examination of a biopsy specimen shows the presence of elongated filiform papillae over the dorsum of the tongue, with surface contamination by clusters of

microorganisms and fungi. The underlying lamina propria is generally mildly inflamed.
Diagnosis
Because the clinical features of this lesion are usually quite characteristic, confirmation by biopsy is not necessary. Cytologic or culture studies are of little value.
Treatment and Prognosis
Identification of a possible etiologic factor, such as antibiot- ics or oxygenating mouth rinses, is helpful. Discontinuing one of these agents should result in improvement within a few weeks. In other patients, brushing with a mixture of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) in water or gentle once- daily scraping of the dorsum of the tongue may be benefi- cial. In individuals who have undergone radiotherapy with resultant xerostomia and altered bacterial flora, manage- ment is more difficult. Brushing the tongue and maintain- ing fastidious oral hygiene should be of some benefit. It is important to emphasize to patients that this process is en- tirely benign and self-limiting, and that the tongue should return to normal after physical debridement and proper oral hygiene have been instituted.
Dentifrice-Associated Slough
Dentifrice-associated slough is a relatively common phe- nomenon that has been associated with the use of several different brands of toothpaste. It is believed to be a superfi- cial chemical burn or a reaction to a component in the dentifrice, possibly the detergent or flavoring compounds. This process may be related to the use of essential oil– containing mouth rinses. Clinically, it appears as a superfi- cial whitish slough of the buccal mucosa, typically detected by the patient as oral peeling that easily swipes away (Figure 3-19). The condition is painless and is not

known to progress to anything significant. The problem resolves with a switch to another, blander toothpaste or mouth rinse.
White mucosal changes have been described in associa- tion with the use of toothpaste and mouthwashes contain- ing the substance sanguinaria (Figure 3-20). The alteration is typically seen in the maxillary vestibule, although other sites may be affected.
Preneoplastic and Neoplastic Lesions
Actinic Cheilitis
Actinic, or solar, cheilitis represents accelerated tissue degen- eration of the vermilion (dry mucous membrane) of the lips, especially the lower lip, as a result of chronic exposure to sun- light; it is considered to represent a potentially premalignant condition. This condition occurs almost exclusively in whites and is especially prevalent in those with fair skin. It shares a common pathogenesis with actinic keratosis of the skin.
Etiology and Pathogenesis
The wavelengths of light most responsible for actinic cheili- tis and, in general, other degenerative actinically related skin conditions are usually considered to be those between
2900 and 3200 nm (ultraviolet B [UVB]). This radiant energy affects not only the epithelium, but also the superfi- cial supporting connective tissue.
Clinical Features
The affected vermilion of the lips takes on an atrophic, pale to silvery gray, glossy appearance, often with fissuring and wrinkling at right angles to the cutaneous-vermilion junc- tion (Figure 3-21; Box 3-8). Slightly firm, bilateral swelling of the lower lip is common. In advanced cases, the normally distinct mucocutaneous junction is irregular or totally ef- faced, with a degree of epidermization of the vermilion. Mottled areas of hyperpigmentation and keratosis are often noted, as well as superficial scaling, cracking, erosion, ulcer- ation, and crusting (Figure 3-22).
Histopathology
The overlying epithelium is typically atrophic and hyper- keratotic and may show epithelial dysplasia from mild to

severe (Figure 3-23). Basophilic changes in the submucosa termed solar elastosis (altered elastin that replaces normal collagen) and telangiectasia are also seen.
Treatment
Because of the positive relationship between exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light and carcinoma, lip protection is indi- cated. The use of lip balm containing a sunscreen agent such as para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) or its derivatives is indicated during periods of sun exposure in high-risk pa- tients. Sun-blocking agents such as titanium dioxide or zinc oxide provide complete protection from both ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB) rays and are preferrable.
Chronic sun damage mandates periodic examination and a biopsy if ulceration persists or if induration occurs. If atypical changes are noted within the epithelium, a vermil- ionectomy may be performed in association with mucosal advancement to replace the damaged vermilion. This opera- tion is associated with some morbidity, primarily related to lip paresthesia, therefore prompting some to advocate wedge excision for suspicious lesions. Acceptable results are attainable with the use of laser surgery or cryosurgery, as well as with topical 5-fluorouracil. Topical imiquimod, an immune stimulant, has been used with clearing of lesions noted within 4 weeks of treatment completion.
CHAPTER 3 White Lesions Actinic Keratoses (Solar Keratoses)
Actinic keratoses of the skin, the cutaneous counterpart of actinic cheilitis, are epithelial changes noted typically in light- complexioned individuals who have had long-term exposure to sunlight. A small percentage of these lesions develop into squamous cell carcinoma. Outdoor workers and individuals participating in extensive outdoor recreation are particularly prone to the development of actinic keratoses.
Oval plaques, usually smaller than 1 cm in diameter, are typically found on the forehead, cheeks, temples, ears, and lateral portions of the neck. The color may vary from yel- low-brown to red, and the texture is usually rough and sandpaper-like.
Common to the many actinic keratosis microscopic sub- types are nuclear atypia, an increased nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio, and atypical proliferation of basal cells. The dermis generally contains a lymphocytic inflammatory cell infil- trate. Elastotic or basophilic changes in collagen and irregu- lar clumps of altered elastic fibers and regenerated collagen are noted in these areas.
Individual actinic keratoses may be treated with cryother- apy. However, in patients with confluent actinic keratoses, the therapeutic mainstay is topical application of 5-fluorouracil. Additional treatment modalities include curettage and surgi- cal excision. For lesions that are indurated or nodular, or that demonstrate marked inflammation, a biopsy to rule out inva- sive squamous cell carcinoma is necessary.
Idiopathic Leukoplakia
Leukoplakia is a descriptive clinical term indicating a white patch or plaque of oral mucosa that cannot be rubbed off and cannot be characterized clinically as any other disease. This excludes lesions such as lichen planus, candidiasis, leukoedema, WSN, and obvious frictional keratosis. Leu- koplakias may have similar clinical appearances, but also have a considerable degree of microscopic heterogeneity. Because leukoplakia may range microscopically from be- nign hyperkeratosis to invasive squamous cell carcinoma, a biopsy is mandatory to establish a definitive diagnosis.
Etiology and Pathogenesis
Many cases of leukoplakia are etiologically related to the use of tobacco in smoked or smokeless forms and may regress after discontinuation of tobacco use. Other factors, such as alcohol abuse, trauma, and C. albicans infection, may have a role in the development of leukoplakia. Nutritional fac- tors have been cited as important, especially relative to iron deficiency anemia and development of sideropenic dyspha- gia (Plummer-Vinson or Paterson-Kelly syndromes).
Rates of transformation to squamous cell carcinoma have varied from study to study as a result of differences in the underlying pathology and differences in the use of putative carcinogens such as tobacco. Geographic differ- ences in the transformation rate, as well as in the preva- lence and location of oral leukoplakias, are likely related to differences in tobacco habits in various parts of the world. In U.S. populations, a majority of oral leukoplakias are

benign and probably never become malignant. Approxi- mately 5% of leukoplakias are malignant at the time of first biopsy, and approximately 5% of the remainder un- dergo subsequent malignant transformation. From 10% to 15% of dysplasias that present as clinical leukoplakia will develop into squamous cell carcinoma (Figures 3-24 and 3-25). Wide ranges in risk of transformation have been observed from one anatomic site to another, such as the floor of the mouth, where transformation rates are comparatively high, although paradoxically many show only minimal amounts of epithelial dysplasia.
Clinical Features
Leukoplakia is a condition associated with middle-aged and older populations. A vast majority of cases occur after the age of 40 years. Over time, a shift in gender predilection has been
noted, with near parity in the incidence of leukoplakia, appar- ently as a result of the change in smoking habits of women.
Predominant sites of occurrence have changed through the years (Box 3-9). At one time, the tongue was the most

common site for leukoplakia, but this area has given way to the mandibular mucosa and the buccal mucosa, which ac- count for almost half of leukoplakias (Figures 3-26 to 3-29). The palate, maxillary ridge, and lower lip are some- what less often involved, and the floor of the mouth and retromolar sites are involved less often.
The relative risk of neoplastic transformation varies from one region to another. Although the floor of the

mouth accounts for a relatively small percentage (10%) of leukoplakias, a large percentage of leukoplakias at this site are found to be dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, or invasive carcinoma when examined microscopically. Leukoplakia of the lips and tongue also exhibits a relatively high percentage of dysplastic or neoplastic change. In contrast to these sites, the retromolar area exhibits these changes in only about 10% of cases.
On visual examination, leukoplakia may vary from a barely evident, vague whiteness on a base of uninflamed, normal-appearing tissue to a definitive white, thickened, leathery, fissured, verrucous (wartlike) lesion. Red zones may also be seen in some leukoplakias, prompting use of the term speckled leukoplakia (erythroleukoplakia). Risk of malignant transformation of speckled leukoplakia is greater than lesions that are homogeneous. On palpation, lesions may be soft, smooth, or finely granular. Other lesions may be roughened, nodular, or indurated.
Proliferative verrucous leukoplakia (PVL) has been segregated from other leukoplakias. This type of leukopla- kia, often on the gingiva, begins as simple keratosis and eventually becomes verrucous in nature (Figure 3-30). Lesions tend to be persistent, multifocal, recurrent, and sometimes locally infiltrative. Metastasis to regional lymph

White Lesions
nodes is uncommon. The cause of PVL is unknown, al- though early reports suggest a relationship in some lesions with human papillomavirus (HPV), but this association has not been substantiated. The typical patient with PVL more often is female than male, and traditional risk factors at- tributed to oral cancer such as tobacco and alcohol use are strongly lacking. The diagnosis is determined clinicopatho- logically and usually is made retrospectively. Malignant transformation to verrucous or squamous cell carcinoma from precursor lesions is greater than in epithelial dysplasia and may occur in up to 80% of cases.
Histopathology
Histologic changes range from hyperkeratosis, dysplasia, and carcinoma in situ to invasive squamous cell carcinoma (Figures 3-31 to 3-33). The term dysplasia indicates an abnormal epithelium and disordered growth, whereas atypia refers to abnormal nuclear features (Box 3-10). Increasing degrees of dysplasia are designated as mild, moderate, and severe and are subjectively determined mi- croscopically. Specific microscopic characteristics of dys- plasia include: (1) drop-shaped epithelial ridges, (2) basal cell crowding, (3) irregular stratification, (4) increased and abnormal mitotic figures, (5) premature keratinization, (6) nuclear pleomorphism and hyperchromatism, and (7) an increased nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio.
• Figure 3-31 Idiopathic leukoplakia diagnosed as hyperkeratosis.

It is generally accepted that the more severe the epithelial changes, the more likely a lesion is to evolve into cancer. Cur- rently there are no microscopic or molecular methods that can predict which individual dysplasia, irrespective of grade, will progress to squamous cell carcinoma. When the entire thick- ness of epithelium is involved with these changes in a so-called top-to-bottom pattern, the term carcinoma in situ may be used. Carcinoma in situ is the concept that malignant epithe- lial transformation has occurred but that invasion into the stroma cannot be demonstrated. Carcinoma in situ is not re- garded as a reversible lesion, although it may take many years for invasion to occur. A majority of squamous cell carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract, including the oral cavity, are preceded by epithelial dysplasia. Conceptually, invasive carci- noma begins when a microfocus of epithelial cell invades the lamina propria 1 to 2 mm beyond the basal lamina. At this early stage, the risk of regional metastasis is low.
Differential Diagnosis
The first step in developing a differential diagnosis for a white patch (leukoplakia) on the oral mucosa is to deter- mine whether the lesion can be removed with a gauze square or a tongue blade. If the lesion can be removed, it may represent a pseudomembrane, a fungus colony, or debris. If bilateral buccal mucosal disease is evident, then hereditary conditions, cheek chewing, lichen planus, and lupus erythematosus (LE) should be considered. Con- comitant cutaneous lesions would give weight to the latter two. If chronic trauma or tobacco use is elicited in the
  • BOX 3-10
Dysplasia: Microscopic Features

patient’s history, frictional or tobacco-associated hyper- keratosis, respectively, should be considered. Elimination of a suspected cause should result in some clinical im- provement. Hairy leukoplakia and geographic tongue would also be included in a differential diagnosis for tongue leukoplakia.
If the lesion in question is not removable and is not clinically diagnostic, it should be considered an idiopathic leukoplakia and a biopsy should be performed. For exten- sive lesions, multiple biopsies may be necessary to avoid sample error. The clinically most suspicious areas (red, ul- cerated, or indurated areas) should be included in the area to be biopsied.
Clinical investigators have suggested that alveolar ridge keratosis is a distinct entity and should be separated from other oral (premalignant) leukoplakias. Alveolar ridge keratoses appear to be caused by chronic friction and when biopsied are diagnosed as benign keratosis (more than 97% have been found to represent hyperkeratosis without dysplasia). Lesions present as asymptomatic white plaques or papules on the mandibular or maxillary alveolar ridges, attached gingiva or retromolar pad, or areas of frictional or occlusal trauma. Microscopically, simple hyperorthokeratosis without significant underly- ing inflammation is seen. Studies using immunomarkers specific for dysplasia have been negative. Clinical judg- ment is necessary to determine whether biopsy is in the best interest of the patient.
Treatment and Prognosis
In the absence of dysplastic or atypical epithelial changes, periodic examination and rebiopsy of new suspicious areas of leukoplakia are recommended. If a lesion is mildly dys- plastic, some clinical judgment should be exercised in pa- tient management. Removal of mildly dysplastic lesions is in the patient’s best interest if no causative factor is apparent and the lesion is small (Figure 3-34). If considerable mor- bidity would result because of the lesion’s size or location, follow-up surveillance is acceptable, provided the degree of epithelial dysplasia is mild.
Surgical excision and other physical forms of ablation are the currently preferred treatment modalities, although it is not clear if these strategies may eliminate or significantly reduce the risk of recurrence or malignant transformation. Medical management of dysplastic lesions with the use of topical agents has not proved effective. If leukoplakia is diagnosed as moderate to severe dysplasia, excision of the clinically visible lesion becomes obligatory. Although surgi- cal excision may be followed by recurrence, excision offers the opportunity to examine the lesion histologically in its entirety for the presence or absence of higher grades of dys- plasia or carcinoma. It was long believed that excision did not alter the natural history of the disease; newer analyses of large populations suggest that this may reduce the risk of neoplastic transformation. Various surgical methods such as scalpel excision, cryosurgery, electrosurgery, and laser sur- gery seem to be equally effective in ablating these lesions. It
• Figure 3-34 Idiopathic leukoplakia: diagnosis and management.
is important to remember that ablation methods do not offer the opportunity to examine the lesion microscopically. For large lesions, grafting procedures may be necessary after surgery. It is important to note that many idiopathic leuko- plakias may recur after complete removal. It is impossible to predict which lesions will return and which will not. Al- though the risk of malignant transformation of oral leuko- plakia is low, long-term follow-up is mandatory, and repeat biopsy should be considered if the clinical findings dictate.
Other White Lesions
Geographic Tongue
Etiology
Geographic tongue, also known as erythema migrans and benign migratory glossitis, is a condition of unknown cause. Geographic tongue is more prevalent among whites and blacks than Mexican Americans and is strongly associated with fissured tongue, but it is inversely associated with ciga- rette smoking. In a few patients, emotional stress may en- hance the process. Geographic tongue has been associated, coincidentally, with several different conditions, including psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, Reiter’s syndrome, and atopy.
Clinical Features
Geographic tongue is seen in approximately 2% of the U.S. population and affects women slightly more often than men (Box 3-11). It is more prevalent in the young, in nonsmok- ers, and in allergic or atopic individuals. Children between infancy and 10 years of age may be affected in up to 18% of cases. Geographic tongue is characterized initially by the presence of atrophic patches surrounded by elevated kera- totic margins. The desquamated areas appear red and may be slightly tender (Figures 3-35 to 3-38). When followed over a period of days or weeks, the pattern changes, appear- ing to move across the dorsum of the tongue. A strong

association has been noted between geographic tongue and fissured (plicated) tongue. The significance of this associa- tion is unknown, although symptoms may be more com- mon when fissured tongue is present, presumably because of secondary fungal infection in the base of the fissures.
• Figure 3-37 Geographic tongue.
• Figure 3-38 Geographic tongue.
Rarely, similar alterations have been described in the floor of the mouth, the buccal mucosa, and the gingiva. Red atrophic lesions and white keratotic margins mimic the lingual counterparts.
Although most patients with geographic tongue are asymptomatic, patients occasionally report irritation or tenderness, especially in relation to the consumption of spicy foods and alcoholic beverages. The severity of symp- toms varies over time and is often an indicator of the inten- sity of lesional activity. Lesions periodically disappear and recur for no apparent reason.
Histopathology
Filiform papillae are atrophic, and the margins of the lesion demonstrate hyperkeratosis and acanthosis (Figure 3-39). Closer to the central portion of the lesion, corresponding to the circinate erythematous areas, loss of keratin is noted, along with intraepithelial neutrophils and lymphocytes. Leukocytes are often noted within a microabscess near the surface. An inflammatory cell infiltrate within the underlying lamina pro- pria, consisting chiefly of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and plasma cells, is seen. Although the histologic picture is reminis- cent of psoriasis, a clinical link between geographic tongue and cutaneous psoriasis has not been substantiated and is likely the coincidental occurrence of two relatively common conditions.

CHAPTER 3 White Lesions
 • Figure 3-39 Geographic tongue biopsy specimen showing hyperkeratotic epithelium adjacent to edematous and inflamed epithelium.
Differential Diagnosis
Based on clinical appearance, geographic tongue is usually diagnostic. Only rarely might a biopsy be required for a definitive diagnosis. In equivocal cases, clinical differential diagnosis might include candidiasis, leukoplakia, lichen planus, and lupus erythematosus.
Treatment and Prognosis
Because of the self-limiting and usually asymptomatic na- ture of this condition, treatment is not required. However, when symptoms occur, treatment is empirical. Considerable benefit may be gained by keeping the mouth clean using a mouth rinse composed of sodium bicarbonate in water, a mucolytic that reduces the film present on the surface of the tongue. Topical steroids, especially those containing an anti- fungal agent, may be helpful in reducing symptoms. Reas- suring patients that this condition is benign and does not portend more serious disease helps relieve anxiety.
Lichen Planus
Lichen planus is a chronic mucocutaneous disease of un- known cause, with oral lesions occurring most commonly in women between 30 and 60 years of age. It is relatively common, affecting between 0.2% and 2% of the popula- tion. In the oral mucosa, it typically presents as bilateral white lesions, occasionally with associated ulcers. The im- portance of this disease is related to its frequency of occur- rence, its occasional similarity to other mucosal diseases, its occasionally painful and persistent nature, and its possible relationship to squamous cell carcinoma.
Etiology and Pathogenesis
Although the cause of lichen planus is unknown, it is gener- ally considered to be an immunologically mediated process that microscopically resembles a hypersensitivity reaction (Figure 3-40). In a minority of patients, possible initiators include dental materials, stress, drugs, and infectious agents. It is characterized by an intense T-cell infiltrate (CD4 and especially CD8 cells) localized along the epithelial-connective tissue interface. Other immune-regulating cells (macro- phages, factor XIIIa-positive dendrocytes, Langerhans cells)
are seen in increased numbers in lichen planus tissue. The disease mechanism appears to involve several steps that could be described as follows: an initiating factor/event, focal re- lease of regulatory cytokines, upregulation of vascular adhe- sion molecules, recruitment and retention of T cells, and cytotoxicity of basal keratinocytes mediated by T cells.
The factor that initiates lichen planus is unknown. It is apparent, however, that recruitment and retention of acti- vated CD81 T-lymphocytes is central to the process. From what is known of leukocyte kinetics in tissue, attraction of lymphocytes to a particular site would require cytokine- mediated upregulation of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells and concomitant expression of receptor molecules by circulating lymphocytes. In oral lichen planus, increased expression of several vascular adhesion molecules is in fact noted (known by acronyms ELAM-1 [endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1], ICAM-1 [intercellular adhesion mol- ecule 1], and VCAM-1 [vascular cell adhesion molecule 1]), along with infiltrating lymphocytes that express reciprocal re- ceptors (known as L-selectin, LFA-1 [lymphocyte function– associated antigen], and VLA-4 [very late activation antigen 4]), supporting the hypothesis that a lymphocyte homing mechanism is activated in lichen planus. Induction of TH1 cytokines appears to be an early and important event in this process. Some of the cytokines believed to be responsible for the upregulated adhesion molecules are tumor necrosis fac- tor-alpha (TNF-a), interleukin-1, and interferon-a. The source of these cytokines is thought to be resident macro- phages, factor XIIIa–positive dendrocytes, Langerhans cells, or the lymphocytes themselves.
The overlying keratinocytes in lichen planus have a sig- nificant role in disease pathogenesis. They may be another source of the chemoattractive and proinflammatory cyto- kines mentioned earlier; more important, they appear to be the immunologic target of the recruited lymphocytes. This latter role seems to be enhanced through keratinocyte ex- pression of the adhesion molecule ICAM-1, which would be attractive to lymphocytes with corresponding receptor molecules (LFA-1). This could set up a favorable relation- ship between T cells and keratinocytes for cytotoxicity. The T cells appear to mediate basal cell death through the trig- gering of apoptosis.
Clinical Features
Oral lichen planus is a disease of middle age that affects women more frequently, with children rarely affected (Box 3-12). Curiously, lichen planus of the skin is more common in men compared with women. The severity of the disease often parallels the patient’s level of stress, although no evidence suggests that stress alone is a cause of this con- dition; it appears to be a modifying factor in some cases. An association between lichen planus and hepatitis C infection has been suggested, with a concomitant geographic influ- ence or cofactor proposed. In studies of Italian patients, HLA-DR6 is a risk factor of hepatitis C-associated lichen planus. No relationship between lichen planus and hyper- tension or diabetes mellitus, as was previously proposed, has been noted. Many of these cases likely represent lichenoid

Several types of lichen planus within the oral cavity have been described. The most common type is the reticular form, which is characterized by numerous interlacing white
keratotic lines or striae (so-called Wickham’s striae) that produce an annular or lacy pattern. The buccal mucosa is the site most commonly involved (Figures 3-41 to 3-46). Striae, although occurring typically in a symmetric pattern on the buccal mucosa bilaterally, may also be noted on the tongue and less commonly on the gingiva and the lips. Al- most any mucosal tissue may demonstrate manifestations of lichen planus. This form generally presents with minimal clinical symptoms and is often an incidental discovery.
The plaque form of lichen planus tends to resemble leu- koplakia clinically but has a multifocal distribution. Such plaques generally range from slightly elevated to smooth and flat. The primary sites for this variant are the dorsum of the tongue and the buccal mucosa.
The erythematous or atrophic form of lichen planus ap- pears as red patches with very fine white striae. It may be seen in conjunction with reticular or erosive variants. The proportion of keratinized areas to atrophic areas varies from one area to another. The attached gingiva, commonly in- volved in this form of lichen planus, exhibits a patchy dis- tribution, often in four quadrants. Patients may complain of burning, sensitivity, and generalized discomfort.
In the erosive form of lichen planus, the central area of the lesion is ulcerated. A fibrinous plaque or pseudomem- brane covers the ulcer. The process is a rather dynamic one, with changing patterns of involvement noted from week to week. Careful examination usually demonstrates

keratotic striae peripheral to the site of erosion, along with erythema.
A rarely encountered form of lichen planus is the bullous variant. Bullae range from a few millimeters to centimeters in diameter. Such bullae are generally short lived and, on rupturing, leave a painful ulcer. Lesions are usually seen on the buccal mu- cosa, especially in the posterior and inferior regions adjacent to the second and third molars. Lesions are less common on the tongue, gingiva, and inner aspect of the lips. Reticular or striated keratotic areas should be seen with this variant of lichen planus.
On the skin, lichen planus is characterized by the presence of small, violaceous, polygonal, flat-topped, pruritic papules on the flexor surfaces of the forearm and anterior tibial sur- faces. Other clinical varieties include hypertrophic, atrophic, bullous, follicular, and linear forms. Cutaneous lesions have

been reported in 20% to 60% of patients with oral lichen planus. Although the oral changes are relatively persistent over time, corresponding skin lesions tend to wax and wane and exhibit a relatively short natural history (1-2 years).
Histopathology
The microscopic criteria for lichen planus include hyperkerato- sis, basal layer vacuolization with apoptotic keratinocytes, and a lymphophagocytic infiltrate at the epithelium–connective tissue interface (Figures 3-47 to 3-50). Over time, the epithe- lium undergoes gradual remodeling, resulting in reduced thickness and occasionally a sawtooth rete ridge pattern. Within the epithelium are increased numbers of Langerhans cells (as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry), presumably processing and presenting antigens to subjacent T cells. Dis- crete eosinophilic ovoid bodies representing the apoptotic ke- ratinocytes are noted at the basal zone. These colloid, or Civatte, bodies are seen in other conditions such as drug reactions, contact hypersensitivity, LE, and some nonspecific inflammatory reactions.
Direct immunofluorescence demonstrates the presence of fibrinogen in the basement membrane zone in 90% to 100% of cases. Although immunoglobulins and comple- ment factors may be found as well, they are far less common than fibrinogen deposits.
Differential Diagnosis
Other diseases with a multifocal bilateral presentation that should be included in a clinical differential diagnosis are lichenoid drug reaction, lupus erythematosus (LE), white sponge nevus, hairy leukoplakia, cheek chewing,

Treatment and Prognosis
Although oral lichen planus generally cannot be cured, some drugs can provide satisfactory control. Corticosteroids are the single most useful group of drugs in the manage- ment of lichen planus. The rationale for their use is their ability to modulate inflammation and the immune re- sponse. Topical application and local injection of steroids have been used successfully in controlling, but not curing this disease. In circumstances in which symptoms are se- vere, systemic steroids may be used for initial management. The addition of antifungal therapy to a corticosteroid regi- men typically enhances clinical results. This is likely a result of elimination of secondary C. albicans growth in lichen planus–involved tissue. Antifungals also prevent the over- growth of C. albicans that may be associated with topical corticosteroid use. Application of topical calcineurin in- hibitors such as tacrolimus and pimecrolimus can be used in steroid-resistant cases, or in instances where corticoste- roids are contraindicated, though the response tends to be less dramatic than with topical steroids.
Because of their antikeratinizing and immunomodulat- ing effects, systemic and topical vitamin A analogs (reti- noids) have been used in the management of lichen planus. Reversal of white striae can be achieved with topical reti- noids, although the effects may be only temporary. Sys- temic retinoids have been used in cases of severe lichen planus with various degrees of success. The benefits of sys- temic therapy must be weighed carefully against the signifi- cant side effects, including cheilitis, elevation of serum liver enzyme and triglyceride levels, and teratogenicity. In cases with significant tissue involvement, more than one drug may be indicated. Various combinations of systemic ste- roids, topical steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and retinoids may be used with some success. Some cases of oral lichen planus may respond to systemic hydroxychloroquine.
Clinical overdiagnosis of lichen planus, coincidental oc- currence of lichen planus and oral cancer, and microscopic confusion with dysplasias that have lichenoid features have contributed to the controversy over malignant potential of this disease. Nonetheless, it appears that there is a small but

White Lesions
bona fide risk that oral squamous cell carcinoma will develop in oral lichen planus, but this risk is very low (approximately 1% at 5 years) and probably is lower than reported rates. If malignant transformation occurs, it is more likely to be associated with erosive and atrophic forms of the disease and particularly in those who smoke. Because lichen planus is a chronic condition, patients should be observed periodically and should be offered education about the clinical course, rationale of therapy, and possible risk of malignant transformation.
Lupus Erythematosus
Lupus erythematosus (LE) may be seen in one of two well- recognized forms: systemic (acute) lupus erythematosus (SLE) and discoid (chronic) lupus erythematosus (DLE), both of which may have oral manifestations. A third form, known as subacute lupus, has also been described. In the spectrum of LE, SLE is of particular importance because of the profound impact it has on many organs. DLE is the less aggressive form, predominantly affecting the skin and rarely progressing to the systemic form. It may, however, be of great cosmetic significance because of its predilection for the face. Subacute cutaneous LE, described as lying inter- mediate between SLE and DLE, results in skin lesions of mild to moderate severity. It is marked by mild systemic involvement and the appearance of some abnormal autoan- tibodies.
Etiology and Pathogenesis
LE is believed to be an autoimmune disease involving both humoral and cell-mediated arms of the immune system.
Autoantibodies directed against various cellular antigens in the nucleus and the cytoplasm have been identified. These antibodies may be found in the serum or tissue, bound to antigens. Circulating antibodies are responsible for the posi- tive reactions noted in the antinuclear antibody (ANA) and LE cell tests that are performed to help confirm the diagno- sis of lupus. Also circulating in serum are antigen-antibody complexes that mediate disease in many organ systems.
Clinical Features
Discoid Lupus Erythematosus. Discoid lupus erythema- tosus is characteristically seen in middle age, especially in women. Lesions commonly appear solely on the skin, most commonly on the face and scalp (Table 3-3; Figures 3-51 to 3-54). Oral and vermilion lesions are commonly seen, but usually in the company of cutaneous lesions. On the skin, lesions appear as disc-shaped erythematous plaques with hyperpigmented margins. As the lesion expands peripher- ally, the center heals, and formation of scar and loss of pig- ment are noted. Involvement of hair follicles results in permanent hair loss (alopecia).
Mucous membrane lesions appear in about 3% to 25% of patients with cutaneous DLE. The buccal mucosa, gingiva,

and vermilion are most commonly affected. Lesions may be erythematous or ulcerative with delicate white, keratotic striae radiating from the periphery. The diagnosis of oral le- sions may not be evident on the basis of clinical appearance. Progression of DLE to SLE is very unlikely, although the potential does exist.
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. In SLE, skin and muco- sal lesions are relatively mild, and patients’ complaints are dominated by multiple organ involvement (Figure 3-55). Numerous autoantibodies directed against nuclear and
• Figure 3-55 Systemic lupus erythematosus, oral lesion.
cytoplasmic antigens are found in SLE-affected patients. These antibodies, when complexed to their corresponding antigens in serum or in the target organ, can cause lesions in nearly any tissue, resulting in a wide variety of clinical signs and symptoms.
Involvement of the skin results in an erythematous rash, classically seen over malar processes and the bridge of the nose. This “butterfly” distribution is usually associated with SLE. Other areas of the face, trunk, and hands may also be involved. The lesions are nonscarring and may flare as sys- temic involvement progresses.
Oral lesions of SLE are generally similar to those seen in DLE and are noted in 9% to 45% of cases. Ulceration, ery- thema, and keratosis may be seen. In addition to the vermil- ion, the labial and buccal mucosa, gingiva, and palate are often involved.
Systemic symptoms of SLE may initially consist of fever, weight loss, and malaise. Typically, with disease progression many organ systems become involved. The joints, kidneys, heart, and lungs are most commonly affected, although many other organs may express manifestations of this dis- ease. Kidney lesions (glomerulonephritis) showing a range of forms and severity are, however, the most important, because they are most commonly responsible for the mor- bidity and mortality of SLE-affected patients.
Serologic tests for autoantibodies yield positive results in patients with SLE. The ANA test is regarded as a reliable and relatively specific test for SLE. Among the antibodies that may cause a positive ANA test result are anti–single- strand DNA, anti–double-strand DNA, and antinuclear ribonuclear protein. Specific tests for these and other auto- antibodies of SLE are available. Another serologic test for SLE is the LE cell test, although it is less sensitive and less specific than the ANA test. Antibodies to Ro (SS-A) and La (SS-B) cytoplasmic antigens may also be present in SLE.
Histopathology
In DLE, basal cell destruction, hyperkeratosis, epithelial atrophy, lymphocytic infiltration (subepithelial and perivas- cular distribution), and vascular dilation with edema of the submucosa are seen (Figure 3-56). It appears that basal

keratinocytes are a primary target in mucous membranes. Because this is also the case for lichen planus, the two dis- eases may be difficult, on occasion, to separate by routine microscopic studies. Demonstration of CD123+ plasmacy- toid dendritic cells may aid in differentiation.
In SLE, oral lesions are microscopically similar to lesions of DLE, although inflammatory cell infiltrates are less intense and more diffuse. The epithelial lesions are hyperproliferative in nature and are positive for cytokeratin markers CK 5/6 and CK 14. Other organs, when involved in SLE, show vas- culitis, mononuclear infiltrates, and fibrinoid necrosis. Direct immunofluorescent testing of skin and mucosal lesions shows granular-linear deposits of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgA), complement (C3), and fibrinogen along the basement membrane zone in a majority of patients.
Differential Diagnosis
Clinically, lesions of oral LE most often resemble erosive lichen planus but tend to be less symmetrically distributed. The kera- totic striae of LE are more delicate and subtle than Wickham’s striae of lichen planus and show characteristic radiation from a central focus. Erythematous gingival lupus may be confused with mucous membrane pemphigoid, erythematous lichen planus, erythematous candidiasis, and contact hypersensitivity.
Treatment
DLE is usually treated with topical corticosteroids. High- potency corticosteroid ointments can be used intraorally. In refractory cases, antimalarials or sulfones may be used.
Systemic steroids may be used in the treatment of SLE. The prednisone dose is generally dependent on the severity of the disease, and prednisone may be combined with immunosuppressive agents for their therapeutic and steroid-sparing effects. Antimalarials and nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs may help control this disease.

predisposing conditions. Clinical presentation is variable and is dependent on whether the condition is acute or chronic (Box 3-13).
Etiology and Pathogenesis
Candidiasis is caused by C. albicans and much less commonly by other species of Candida: C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. pseudotropicalis, and C. guilliermondii. C. albicans is a commensal organism re- siding in the oral cavity in a majority of healthy persons. Transformation, or escape from a state of commensalism to that of a pathogen, relates to local and systemic factors. The organism is a unicellular yeast of the Saccharomycetaceae family and may exist in three distinct biological and mor- phologic forms: (1) the vegetative or yeast form of oval cells (blastospores), measuring 1.5 to 5 mm in diameter; (2) the elongated cellular form (pseudohyphae); and (3) the chla- mydospore form, which consists of cell bodies measuring 7 to 17 mm in diameter, with a thick, refractile enclosing wall. As evidenced by its frequency in the general popula- tion, C. albicans is of weak pathogenicity, thereby reflecting the necessity for local or systemic predisposing factors to produce a disease state (Box 3-14).
Infection with this organism is usually superficial, affect- ing the outer aspects of the involved oral mucosa or skin. In

severely debilitated and immunocompromised patients, such as patients with AIDS, infection may extend into the alimentary tract (candidal esophagitis), the bronchopulmo- nary tract, or other organ systems. The opportunistic nature of this organism is observed in the frequency of mild forms of the disease resulting from short-term use of systemic antibiotic therapy for minor bacterial infections.
Clinical Features
The most common clinical type of candidiasis is the acute pseudomembranous form, also known as thrush (Box 3-15). Young infants and the elderly are commonly affected. Esti- mates of disease frequency range up to 5% of neonates; 5% of patients with cancer; and 10% of institutionalized, debilitated elderly patients. This infection is common in patients being treated with radiation or chemotherapy for leukemia and solid tumors, with up to half of those in the former group and 70% in the latter group affected. Recalci- trant candidiasis has been recognized in patients who have HIV infection and AIDS.
Oral lesions of acute candidiasis (thrush) are characteristi- cally white, soft plaques that sometimes grow centrifugally and merge (Figures 3-57 to 3-63). Plaques are composed of fungal organisms, keratotic debris, inflammatory cells, des- quamated epithelial cells, bacteria, and fibrin. Wiping away

the plaques or pseudomembranes with a gauze sponge leaves a painful erythematous, eroded, or ulcerated surface. Al- though lesions of thrush may develop at any location, favored sites include the buccal mucosa and mucobuccal folds, the oropharynx, and the lateral aspects of the tongue. In most instances in which the pseudomembrane has not been dis- turbed, associated symptoms are minimal. In severe cases, patients may complain of tenderness, burning, and dysphagia.
Persistence of acute pseudomembranous candidiasis may eventually result in loss of the pseudomembrane, with

presentation as a more generalized red lesion, known as acute erythematous candidiasis. Along the dorsum of the tongue, patches of depapillation and dekeratinization may be noted. In the past, this particular form of candidiasis was known as antibiotic stomatitis or antibiotic glossitis because of its common relationship to antibiotic treatment of acute infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics or concurrent admin- istration of multiple narrow-spectrum antibiotics may pro- duce this secondary infection to a much greater degree than
do single narrow-spectrum antibiotics. Withdrawal of the offending antibiotic, if possible, and institution of appro- priate oral hygiene lead to improvement. In contrast to the acute pseudomembranous form, oral symptoms of the acute atrophic form are marked because of numerous ero- sions and intense inflammation.
Chronic erythematous candidiasis is a commonly seen form, occurring in as many as 65% of geriatric individuals who wear complete maxillary dentures (denture sore mouth). Expression of this form of candidiasis depends on condition- ing of the oral mucosa by a covering prosthesis. A distinct predilection for the palatal mucosa compared with the man- dibular alveolar arch has been noted. Chronic low-grade trauma resulting from poor prosthesis fit, less than ideal oc- clusal relationships, and failure to remove the appliance at night all contribute to the development of this condition. The clinical appearance is that of a bright red, somewhat velvety to pebbly surface, with relatively little keratinization.
Also seen in individuals with denture-related chronic atrophic candidiasis is angular cheilitis. This condition is especially prevalent in individuals who have deep folds at the commissures as a result of mandibular overclosure. In such circumstances, small accumulations of saliva gather in the skin folds at the commissural angles and are subse- quently colonized by yeast organisms (and often by Staphy- lococcus aureus). Clinically, the lesions are moderately pain- ful, fissured, eroded, and encrusted. Angular cheilitis may also occur in individuals who habitually lick their lips and deposit small amounts of saliva in the commissural angles.
A circumoral type of atrophic candidiasis may be noted in those with severe lip-licking habits with extension of the process onto surrounding skin. The skin is fissured and demonstrates a degree of brown discoloration on a slightly erythematous base. This condition is to be distinguished from perioral dermatitis, which characteristically shows less crusting and a circumferential zone of uninvolved skin im- mediately adjacent to the cutaneous-vermilion junction.
Chronic candidal infections are capable of producing a hyperplastic tissue response (chronic hyperplastic candidiasis). When occurring in the retrocommissural area, the lesion re- sembles speckled leukoplakia and, in some classifications, is known as candidal leukoplakia. It occurs in adults with no apparent predisposition to infection by C. albicans, and it is believed by some clinicians to represent a premalignant lesion.
Hyperplastic candidiasis may involve the dorsum of the tongue in a pattern referred to as median rhomboid glossitis. It is usually asymptomatic and is generally discovered on rou- tine oral examination. The lesion is found anterior to the cir- cumvallate papillae and has an oval or rhomboid outline with a paramedian distribution. It may have a smooth, nodular, or fissured surface and may range in color from white to a more characteristic red. A similar-appearing red lesion may also be present on the adjacent hard palate (“kissing lesion”). Whether on the tongue or on the palate, the condition may occasion- ally be mildly painful, although most cases are asymptomatic. In the past, this particular condition was believed to be a de- velopmental anomaly, presumably resulting from persistence

of the tuberculum impar of the developing tongue. Because it is never seen in children, it is more likely a hyperplastic form of candidiasis. Microscopically, epithelial hyperplasia is evi- dent in the form of bulbous rete ridges. C. albicans hyphae usually can be found in the upper levels of the epithelium. A thick band of hyalinized connective tissue separates the epi- thelium from deeper structures.
Nodular papillary lesions of the hard palatal mucosa predominantly seen beneath maxillary complete dentures are thought to represent, at least in part, a response to chronic fungus infection. The papillary hyperplasia is com- posed of individual nodules that are ovoid to spherical and form excrescences measuring 2 to 3 mm in diameter on an erythematous background.
Mucocutaneous candidiasis is a diverse group of condi- tions. The localized form of mucocutaneous candidiasis is characterized by long-standing and persistent candidiasis of the oral mucosa, nails, skin, and vaginal mucosa. This form of candidiasis is often resistant to treatment, with only tem- porary remission following the use of standard antifungal therapy. This form begins early in life, usually within the first two decades. The disease begins as a pseudomembra- nous type of candidiasis and soon is followed by nail and cutaneous involvement.
A familial form of mucocutaneous candidiasis, believed to be transmitted in an autosomal-recessive fashion, occurs in nearly 50% of patients with an associated endocrinopa- thy. The endocrinopathy usually consists of hypoparathy- roidism, Addison’s disease, and occasionally hypothyroidism or diabetes mellitus. Other forms of familial mucocutaneous candidiasis have associated defects in iron metabolism and cell-mediated immunity.
A rare triad of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, myo- sitis, and thymoma has been described. The role of the thymus relates to a deficiency in T cell–mediated immuno- logic function, hence providing an opportunity for the proliferation of Candida.
A final form of candidiasis, both acute and chronic, is evident within the immunosuppressed population of pa- tients, in particular those infected with HIV. This form of candidiasis was originally described in 1981 and is now well
recognized as being one of the more important opportunis- tic infections that afflict this group of patients. The signifi- cantly depleted cell-mediated arm of the immune system is believed to be responsible for allowing the development of severe candidiasis in these patients.
So-called denture stomatitis, a chronic form of erythem- atous candidiasis, is in large measure associated with the prosthesis-related surface biofilm that becomes colonized with candidal organisms. The relationship between dura- tion of denture use and development of this form of candi- diasis has been established.
Histopathology
In acute candidiasis, fungal hyphae are seen penetrating the upper layers of the epithelium at acute angles (Figure 3-64). Neutrophilic infiltration of the epithelium with superficial microabscess formation is typically seen. Fungal forms may be enhanced in tissue sections by staining with methena- mine silver or periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) reagent. The pre- dominant fungal forms growing in this particular form of the disease are pseudohyphae.
Epithelial hyperplasia is a rather characteristic feature of chronic candidiasis. However, organisms may be sparse, making histologic demonstration sometimes difficult. Al- though chronic candidiasis may give rise to oral leukopla- kia, no clear evidence indicates that chronic candidiasis is in and of itself a precancerous state.
Clinical laboratory tests for this organism involve re- moval of a portion of the candidal plaque, which is smeared on a microscope slide and macerated with 20% potassium hydroxide (KOH) or stained with PAS. The slide is subse- quently examined for typical hyphae. Culture identification and quantification of organisms may be done on Sabouraud broth, blood agar, or cornmeal agar.
Differential Diagnosis
Candidal white lesions should be differentiated from slough associated with chemical burns, traumatic ulcerations, mu- cous patches of syphilis, and white keratotic lesions. Red lesions of candidiasis should be differentiated from drug reactions, erosive lichen planus, and DLE.

Systemic
Fluconazole, ketoconazole
*Contains sugar; do not use with dentate patients with xerostomia.
Treatment and Prognosis
Attending to predisposing factors is an important compo- nent of management of patients with candidiasis. The ma- jority of infections may be treated simply with topical ap- plications of nystatin suspension, although this may be ineffective because contact time with the lesion is short (Box 3-16). Nystatin powder, cream, or ointment is often effective when applied directly to the affected tissue on gauze pads and for denture-associated candidiasis when ap- plied directly to the denture-bearing surface itself. In both circumstances, prolonged contact time with the lesion proves to be an effective delivery strategy. Clotrimazole can be conveniently administered in troche form. Topical ap- plications of nystatin, miconazole or clotrimazole should be continued for at least 1 week beyond the disappearance of clinical manifestations of the disease. It is important to note that antifungals designed specifically for oral use contain considerable amounts of sugar, making them undesirable for the treatment of candidiasis in dentate patients with xerostomia. Sugar-free antifungal vaginal suppositories, dis- solved in the mouth, are an excellent treatment alternative to avoid the complications of dental caries.
For hyperplastic candidiasis, topical and systemic antifungal therapy may be ineffective in completely removing the lesions, particularly those that occur on the buccal mucosa, near the commissures. In these circumstances, surgical management may be necessary to complement antifungal medications.
In cases of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis or oral candidiasis associated with immunosuppression, topical agents may not be effective. In such instances, systemic administration of medications such as ketoconazole, fluco- nazole, itraconazole, or others may be necessary. All are available in oral form. Caution must be exercised, however, because these drugs may be hepatotoxic.
The prognosis for acute and most other forms of chronic candidiasis is excellent. The underlying defect in most types of persistent mucocutaneous candidiasis militates against cure, although intermittent improvement may be noted after the use of systemic antifungal agents.
Mucosal Burns
Etiology
The most common form of superficial burn of the oral mu- cosa is associated with topical applications of chemicals,
such as aspirin or caustic agents. Topical abuse of drugs, accidental placement of phosphoric acid-etching solutions or gel by a dentist, or overly fastidious use of alcohol- containing mouth rinses may produce similar effects.
Clinical Features
In cases of short-term exposure to agents capable of induc- ing tissue necrosis, a localized mild erythema may occur (Figure 3-65). As the concentration and contact time of the offending agent increase, surface coagulative necrosis is more likely to occur, resulting in the formation of a white slough, or membrane. With gentle traction, the surface slough peels from the denuded connective tissue, producing pain.
Thermal burns are commonly noted on the hard palatal mucosa and generally are associated with hot, sticky foods. Hot liquids are more likely to burn the tongue or the soft palate. Such lesions are generally erythematous rather than white (necrosis), as is seen with chemical burns.
Another form of burn that is potentially serious is the electrical burn. In particular, children who chew through electrical cords receive rather characteristic initial burns that are often symmetric. The result of these accidents is signifi- cant tissue damage, often followed by scarring. The surface of these lesions tends to be characterized by a thickened slough that extends deep into the connective tissue.
Histopathology
In cases of chemical and thermal burns in which an obvious clinical slough has developed, the epithelial component shows coagulative necrosis through its entire thickness. A fibrinous exudate is also evident. The underlying connective tissue is intensely inflamed. Electrical burns are more de- structive, showing deep extension of necrosis, often into muscle.
Treatment
Management of chemical, thermal, or electrical burns is varied. For patients with thermal or chemical burns, local symptomatic therapy aimed at keeping the mouth clean,

www.konkur.in
such as sodium bicarbonate mouth rinses with or without the use of systemic analgesics, is appropriate. Alcohol-based commercial mouth rinses should be discouraged because of their drying effect on the oral mucosa. For patients with electrical burns, management may be much more difficult. The services of a pediatric dentist or an oral and maxillofa- cial surgeon may be necessary in more severe cases. Pressure stents over the damaged areas may be required to prevent early contracture of the wounds. After healing, further definitive surgical or reconstructive treatment may be neces- sary because of extensive scar formation.
Submucous Fibrosis
Etiology
Several factors contributing to submucous fibrosis include general nutritional or vitamin deficiencies and hypersensi- tivity to various dietary constituents. The primary factor appears to be chewing of the areca (betel) nut. It appears that this condition is due to impaired degradation of nor- mal collagen by fibroblasts rather than excess production. Also, chronic consumption of chili peppers or chronic and prolonged deficiency of iron and B complex vitamins, espe- cially folic acid, increases hypersensitivity to many potential irritants (areca nut, dietary spices, and tobacco), with an attendant inflammatory reaction and fibrosis. It has been reported that a polymorphism of the promoter region of the matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP 3) gene is common in oral submucous fibrosis and may contribute to develop- ment of the disease. Also postulated in terms of pathogen- esis is an increased degree of collagen cross-linking through upregulation of lysyl oxidase activity stimulated by areco- line, an alkaloid contained in the areca nut component of paan and gutka.
Clinical Features
Once rarely seen in North America, submucous fibrosis is relatively common in Southeast Asia, India, and neighboring countries. Recent patterns of immigration to the Western hemisphere have led to an increase in the number of cases. The condition is seen typically between the ages of 20 and 40 and is often associated with the habitual use of com- pounds containing areca (betel) nut and tobacco in various forms, including a quid form (paan) and a powdered form (gutka), where these are placed in the oral cavity for extended periods of time and often are replaced up to several times per day. The addictive properties of this habit are well known, as are the mucosal alterations that accompany long-term use, in particular submucous fibrosis.
Oral submucous fibrosis presents as a whitish yellow change that has a chronic, insidious biological course. It is characteristically seen in the oral cavity, but on occasion it may extend into the pharynx and the esophagus. Submu- cous fibrosis occasionally may be preceded by or may be associated with vesicle formation. Over time, the affected mucosa, especially the soft palate and the buccal mucosa, loses its resilience and shows limited vascularity and elastic- ity. This process then progresses from the lamina propria to
the underlying musculature. Fibrous bands are readily pal- pable in the soft palate and the buccal mucosa. The clinical result is significant trismus with considerable difficulty in eating.
Histopathology
Microscopically, the principal feature is atrophy of the epithe- lium and subjacent fibrosis (Figure 3-66). Epithelial dysplasia occasionally may be evident. The lamina propria is poorly vascularized and hyalinized; fibroblasts are few. A diffuse mild to moderate inflammatory infiltrate is present. Type I collagen predominates in the submucosa, whereas type III collagen tends to localize at the epithelium–connective tissue interface and around blood vessels, salivary glands, and muscle.
Treatment and Prognosis
Eliminating causative agents is part of the management of submucous fibrosis. Therapeutic measures include local injections of chymotrypsin, hyaluronidase, and dexametha- sone, with surgical excision of fibrous bands and submuco- sal placement of vascularized free flap grafts. All methods of treatment, including surgical modalities, however, have proved to be of only modest help in this essentially irrevers- ible condition.
The primary importance of submucous fibrosis relates to its premalignant nature. The development of squamous cell carcinoma has been noted in as many as one third of patients with submucous fibrosis.
Fordyce’s Granules
Fordyce’s granules represent ectopic sebaceous glands or sebaceous choristomas (normal tissue in an abnormal loca- tion). This condition is regarded as developmental and can be considered a variation of normal.
Fordyce’s granules are multiple and often are seen in ag- gregates or in confluent arrangements (Figures 3-67 and 3-68). Sites of predilection include the buccal mucosa and the vermilion of the upper lip. Lesions generally are sym- metrically distributed and tend to become obvious after puberty, with maximal expression occurring between 20 and

30 years of age. Lesions are asymptomatic and often are discovered incidentally by the patient or by the practitioner during a routine oral examination. A large proportion of the population, more than 80% of individuals, is affected by this particular condition.
Microscopically, lobules of sebaceous glands are aggre- gated around or adjacent to excretory ducts. The hetero- topic glands are well formed and appear functional.
No treatment is indicated for this particular condition because the glands are normal in character and do not cause any untoward effects.
Ectopic Lymphoid Tissue
Lymphoid tissue may be found in numerous oral locations, most notably in the region surrounding the oropharynx termed Waldeyer’s ring. Found in the posterolateral aspect of the tongue, it is known as lingual tonsil. Aggregates of lymphoid tissue are commonly seen in the soft palate, floor of the mouth, and tonsillar pillars (Figure 3-69).
Lymphoid tissue appears yellow or yellow-white clini- cally and typically produces small, dome-shaped elevations. The tissue appears uninflamed, and the patient is unaware of its presence. Crypts in the lymphoid tissue occasionally may become obstructed, causing “cystic” dilation of the area. These lesions may be called lymphoepithelial cysts. In
• Figure 3-69 Ectopic lymphoid tissue in the floor of the mouth.
a strict sense, however, lymphoepithelial cysts might be derived from cystic changes of embryonically entrapped epithelium within lymphoid tissue.
Generally, lymphoid tissue can be diagnosed on the basis of clinical features alone. Because this is basically normal tissue, no biopsy may be needed.
Gingival Cysts
Gingival cysts of odontogenic origin occur in adults, as well as in infants (Bohn’s nodules). In infants, relative frequency is greatest in the neonatal phase. They occur along the alveo- lar ridges and involute spontaneously or rupture and exfoli- ate. Another eponym, Epstein’s pearls, has been commonly used to designate nonodontogenic neonatal cysts that occur along the palatal midline (fusion of palatine shelves).
Etiology and Pathogenesis
Neonatal gingival cysts are thought to arise from dental lam- ina remnants. Fetal tissues between 10 and 12 weeks of age show small amounts of keratin within elements of the dental lamina. Toward the end of the 12th week of gestation, disrup- tion of the dental lamina is evident, with many fragments exhibiting central cystification and keratin accumulation. Gingival cysts generally are numerous in the fetus and infant, increasing in number until the 22nd week of gestation.
Midline palatal cysts, or Epstein’s pearls, are thought to result from epithelial entrapment within the midline of palatal fusion. Small epithelial inclusions within the line of fusion produce microcysts that contain keratin and rupture early in life.
The gingival cyst of the adult is probably formed from remnants of the dental lamina (rests of Serres) within the gingival submucosa. Cystic changes in these rests may oc- casionally result in a multilocular lesion. An alternative theory of pathogenesis relates to the traumatic implantation of surface epithelium into gingival connective tissue.
Clinical Features
Gingival cysts in a neonate appear as off-white colored nodules approximately 2 mm in diameter. Cysts ranging in number from one to many are evident along the alveolar crests. Midline

palatal cysts, on the other hand, present along the midpalatal raphe toward the junction of the hard palate and the soft palate. The gingival cyst of adults occurs chiefly during the fifth and sixth decades. It appears more commonly in the man- dible than in the maxilla. A great deal of similarity has been noted between the gingival cyst in the adult and the lateral periodontal cyst, including the site of predilection, the age of occurrence, clinical behavior, and overall morphology. The gingival cyst presents as a painless growth in the at- tached gingiva, often within the interdental papilla. Only rarely are lesions found in the lingual gingiva. Premolar and
bicuspid regions of the mandible are favored locations.
Histopathology
The neonatal gingival cyst is lined by bland stratified squa- mous epithelium and is filled with keratinaceous debris. Gingival cysts in adults are lined by a thin layer of cuboidal or flattened epithelium, with focal thickening that often demonstrates clear cell change.
Treatment
No treatment is indicated for gingival or palatal cysts of the newborn because they spontaneously rupture early in life. Treatment for gingival cyst of the adult is surgical excision.
Parulis
A parulis, or “gum boil,” represents a focus of pus in the gingiva. It is derived from an acute infection at the base of an occluded periodontal pocket or at the apex of a nonvital tooth. The path of least resistance most often leads to gingi- val submucosa. The lesion appears as a yellow-white gingival tumescence with an associated erythema (Figure 3-70). Pain is typical, but once the pus escapes to the surface, symptoms are temporarily relieved. Treatment of the underlying condi- tion (periodontal pocket or nonvital tooth) is required to achieve resolution of the gingival abscess.
Lipoma
Lipoma appears as a yellow or yellow-white uninflamed sub- mucosal mass of adipose tissue. It is included in this section for completeness. Further discussion is found in Chapter 7.

Congenital Hemangiomas and Congenital Vascular Malformations
Etiology
The terms congenital, hemangioma, and congenital vascular malformation have been used as generic designations for many vascular proliferations, and they have been used
interchangeably. Congenital hemangiomas and congenital vascular malformations appear at or around the time of birth and are more common in females. Because of the confusion surrounding the basic origin of many of these lesions, classification of clinical and microscopic varieties has been difficult. None of the numerous proposed classifi- cations has had uniform acceptance, although there is merit in separating benign neoplasms from vascular malforma- tions because of different clinical and behavioral character- istics (Table 4-1). The term congenital hemangioma is used to identify benign congenital neoplasms of proliferating endothelial cells. Congenital vascular malformations in- clude lesions resulting from abnormal vessel morphogene- sis. Separation of vascular lesions into these two groups can be of considerable significance relative to the treatment of patients. Unfortunately, in actual practice, some difficulty may be encountered in classifying lesions in this way be- cause of overlapping clinical and histologic features.
In any event, congenital hemangiomas have traditionally been subdivided into two microscopic types, capillary and cavernous, essentially reflecting differences in vessel diame- ter. Vascular malformations may exhibit similar features but may also show vascular channels that represent arteries and veins.
Clinical Features
Congenital hemangioma, also known as strawberry nevus, usually appears around the time of birth but may not be ap- parent until early childhood (Figure 4-1). This lesion may exhibit a rapid growth phase that is followed several years later by an involution phase. In contrast, congenital vascular malformations are generally persistent lesions that grow with the individual and do not involute (Figures 4-2 to 4-6). They may represent arteriovenous shunts and exhibit a bruit or thrill on auscultation. Both types of lesions may range in color from red to blue, depending on the degree of conges- tion and their depth in tissue. When they are compressed, blanching occurs as blood is pressed peripherally from the central vascular spaces. This simple clinical test (diascopy) can be used to separate these lesions from hemorrhagic le- sions in soft tissue (ecchymoses), where the blood is extravas- cular and cannot be displaced by pressure. Congenital hemangiomas and congenital vascular malformations may

be flat, nodular, or bosselated. Other clinical signs include the presence of a bruit or thrill, features associated predomi- nantly with congenital vascular malformations. Lesions are most commonly found on the lips, tongue, and buccal mu- cosa. Lesions that affect bone are probably congenital vascu- lar malformations rather than congenital hemangiomas.
Vascular malformations are also a component of the rare condition termed blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome (Bean’s syndrome), in which multiple small and large cavernous hemangiomas are present on the skin and throughout the gastrointestinal tract, including the mouth. The condition is usually diagnosed in childhood or young adulthood. Rec- ognition of this syndrome is significant because many of those afflicted may suffer overt life-threatening gastrointes- tinal bleeding or occult blood loss with severe anemia and iron deficiency.
Histopathology
Congenital hemangiomas are composed of abundant capil- lary spaces lined by endothelium without muscular sup- port. Congenital vascular malformations may consist not only of capillaries, but also of venous, arteriolar, and lym- phatic channels. Direct arteriovenous communications are typical. Lesions may be of purely one type of vessel, or they may consist of two or more vessels. Vascular morphology accounts for lesions exhibiting rapid flow versus those exhibiting slow flow.
Diagnosis
As a generic group, the diagnosis of congenital vascular lesions is usually self-evident on clinical examination. When they affect the mandible or the maxilla, a radiolucent lesion with a honeycomb pattern and distinct margins is expected. Differentiation between congenital hemangiomas and con- genital vascular malformations can be difficult and occa- sionally impossible. When affecting a segmental portion of the face or oral cavity, facial hemangiomas may be associ- ated with several syndromes, which may include the eye, heart, and posterior cranial fossa (PHACE syndrome). A complete history, a clinical examination, and angiography or angiographic magnetic resonance imaging should be de- finitive in lesion identification and characterization.

Treatment
Spontaneous involution during early childhood is likely for congenital hemangiomas. If these lesions persist into the later years of childhood, involution is improbable and de- finitive treatment may be required. Good results may be achieved with propranolol, a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent. Congenital vascular malformations generally do not involute, and they may require surgical intervention

if eradication is the goal. Adjuncts include selective arterial embolization and sclerosant therapy. Laser therapy is an- other accepted form of primary treatment of selected vascu- lar lesions. Because the margins of these lesions are often ill defined, total elimination may not be practical or possible.
Encephalotrigeminal Angiomatosis (Sturge-Weber Syndrome)
Encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis, or Sturge-Weber syn- drome, is a noninherited neurocutaneous syndrome that includes vascular malformations with characteristic distri- bution. In this syndrome, venous malformations involve the leptomeninges of the cerebral cortex, usually with simi- lar vascular malformations of the face (Figure 4-7). The associated facial lesion, also known as port-wine stain or

nevus flammeus, involves the skin innervated by one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve. Port-wine stains may also occur as isolated lesions of the skin without the other stigmata of encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis. The vascular defect of encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis may extend intraorally to involve the buccal mucosa and the gingiva. Ocular lesions (vascular malformations, glaucoma) may appear.
Neurologic effects of encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis may include mental retardation, hemiparesis, and seizure disorders. Patients may be taking phenytoin (Dilantin) or similar drugs for control of the latter problem, with possible secondary development of drug-induced generalized gingi- val hyperplasia in relation to phenytoin. Calcification of the intracranial vascular lesion may provide radiologic evidence of the process in the leptomeninges.
A differential diagnosis would include Parkes-Weber syndrome and angio-osteohypertrophy (Klippel-Trenaunay) syndrome, the latter characterized by vascular malforma- tions of the face (port-wine stains), varices, and limb hypertrophy (bone and soft tissues). The bony abnormality usually affects long bones but may also involve the man- dible or maxilla, resulting in asymmetry, malocclusion, and an altered eruption pattern.
Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (Rendu-Osler-Weber Syndrome)
Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), or Rendu- Osler-Weber syndrome, is a rare condition, affecting 1 in 5000 to 8000 people, that is transmitted in an autosomal- dominant manner. Most cases are caused by mutations in two genes: endoglin on chromosome 9 (HHT type 1) and activin receptor–like kinase 1 (ALK 1) on chromosome 12 (HHT type 2). These genes are members of the trans- forming growth factor (TGF)-b signaling pathway and are implicated in vascular development and repair. HHT fea- tures abnormal and fragile vascular dilations of terminal vessels in skin and mucous membranes, as well as arteriove- nous malformations of internal organs, particularly lungs, brain, and liver (Figure 4-8). Telangiectatic vessels in this
condition appear clinically as red macules or papules, typi- cally on the face, chest, and oral mucosa. Lesions appear early in life, persist throughout adulthood, and often in- crease in number with aging.
Intranasal telangiectasias are responsible for epistaxis, the most common presenting sign of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Bleeding from oral lesions is a common oc- currence in affected patients. Occasionally, bleeding may be difficult to control. Chronic low-level bleeding may also result in iron deficiency anemia.
Diagnosis of HHT is based on a history of spontaneous epistaxis, the presence of telangiectasias, arteriovenous mal- formations of internal organs, and family history. Another condition that might be considered in a differential diagno- sis is CREST syndrome. This includes calcinosis cutis, Raynaud’s phenomenon, esophageal dysfunction, sclero- dactyly, and telangiectasia.
Clinical management includes follow-up examination and the use of antifibrinolytic drugs for those with frequent epistaxis.
Reactive Lesions
Varix and Other Acquired Vascular Malformations
A venous varix, or varicosity, is a type of acquired vascular malformation that represents focal dilation of a single vein. It is a trivial, but common, vascular malformation when it appears in the oral mucosa and lips (Figures 4-9 to 4-11). Varices involving the ventral aspect of the tongue are com- mon developmental abnormalities. Varices are also com- mon on the lower lip in older adults, representing vessel wall weakness caused by chronic sun exposure with subse- quent dilation. Varices typically are blue and blanch with compression. Thrombosis, which is insignificant in these lesions, occasionally occurs, giving them a firm texture. No treatment is required for a venous varix unless it is fre- quently traumatized or is cosmetically objectionable.
Other acquired vascular malformations represent a more complex network or proliferation of thin-walled vessels than simple varices. These are relatively common, are seen in

adults, and are of undetermined cause (Figure 4-12). Some may be related to vessel trauma and subsequent abnormal repair. These lesions present as red-blue discrete and asymp- tomatic tumescences that can be excised relatively easily.
Pyogenic Granuloma
Etiology
Pyogenic granuloma represents an exuberant connective tissue proliferation to a known stimulus or injury. It appears
• Figure 4-12 Acquired vascular malformation.
as a red mass because it is composed predominantly of hyperplastic granulation tissue in which capillaries are very prominent. The term pyogenic granuloma is a misnomer because it does not produce pus, nor does it represent granulomatous inflammation (Table 4-2).
Clinical Features
Pyogenic granulomas occur mostly in the second decade of life and are most commonly seen on the attached gingiva (75%), where they presumably are caused by the presence of calculus or foreign material within the gingival crevice (Figures 4-13 to 4-15). The tongue, lower lip, and buccal mucosa are the next most common sites. Hormonal changes

of puberty and pregnancy may modify the gingival repara- tive response to injury, producing what was once called a pregnancy tumor. Under these circumstances, multiple gin- gival lesions or generalized gingival hyperplasia may be seen.
Pyogenic granulomas are typically red and smooth or lobu- lated with hemorrhagic and compressible features. They char- acteristically become ulcerated because of secondary trauma. A yellow, fibrinous membrane may then cover the ulcerated lesions. They may be pedunculated or broad based and may range in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters.
• Figure 4-16 Pyogenic granuloma showing abundant capillaries.
Older lesions become more pink and collagenized. These lesions may be seen at any age and tend to occur more commonly in females than in males; they are seen in up to 5% of pregnancies.
Histopathology
Microscopically, pyogenic granulomas are composed of lob- ular masses of hyperplastic granulation tissue (Figure 4-16). Some scarring may be noted in some of these lesions, sug- gesting that occasionally maturation of the connective tissue repair process may occur. Variable numbers of chronic in- flammatory cells may be seen. Neutrophils are present in the superficial zone of ulcerated pyogenic granulomas.
Differential Diagnosis
Clinically, this lesion is similar to peripheral giant cell granuloma, which also presents as a red gingival mass. A peripheral odontogenic or ossifying fibroma may be an- other consideration, although these tend to be much lighter in color. Less commonly, other conditions that may be con- sidered include Kaposi sarcoma, bacillary angiomatosis, and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Rarely, metastatic cancer may present as a red gingival mass. Biopsy findings are definitive in establishing the diagnosis.
Treatment
Pyogenic granulomas should be surgically excised; removal should include the connective tissue from which the lesion arises, as well as local etiologic factors (plaque, calculus, foreign material, source of trauma). Recurrence is occa- sional and is believed to result from incomplete excision, failure to remove etiologic factors, or reinjury of the area. The end of pregnancy often brings considerable shrinkage of pregnancy-associated pyogenic granulomas, but residual lesions may need to be excised.
Peripheral Giant Cell Granuloma
Etiology
Peripheral giant cell granuloma is a relatively uncommon and unusual hyperplastic connective tissue response to in- jury of gingival tissues. It is one of the “reactive hyperplasias”
CHAPTER 4 Red-Blue Lesions
   119

120 CHAPTER 4
Red-Blue Lesions
commonly seen in oral mucous membranes, representing an exuberant reparative process in association with local trauma or irritation. The feature that sets this lesion apart from the others is the appearance of multinucleated giant cells, but the reason for their presence remains unknown.
Clinical Features
Peripheral giant cell granulomas are seen exclusively in gin- giva, usually between the first permanent molars and the incisors (Figure 4-17). They presumably arise from peri- odontal ligament or periosteum, and occasionally cause resorption of alveolar bone. When this process occurs on the edentulous ridge, a superficial, cup-shaped radiolucency may be seen. Peripheral giant cell granulomas typically appear as red to blue, broad-based masses. Secondary ulcer- ation caused by trauma may result in the formation of a fibrin clot over the ulcer. These lesions, most of which are about 1 cm in diameter, may occur at any age and tend to be seen more commonly in females than in males.
Histopathology
Fibroblasts are the basic element of peripheral giant cell granu- lomas (Figure 4-18). Scattered throughout the fibroblasts are
• Figure 4-17 Peripheral giant cell granuloma.
• Figure 4-18 Peripheral giant cell granuloma showing fibroblastic matrix and abundant multinucleated giant cells.
abundant multinucleated giant cells believed to be related to osteoclasts. The giant cells appear to be nonfunctional in the usual sense of phagocytosis and bone resorption.
Islands of metaplastic bone occasionally may be seen in these lesions. This finding has no clinical significance. Chronic inflammatory cells are present, and neutrophils are found in ulcer bases.
Differential Diagnosis
Generally, peripheral giant cell granuloma is clinically indis- tinguishable from a pyogenic granuloma. Although a pe- ripheral giant cell granuloma is more likely to cause bone resorption than is a pyogenic granuloma, the differences are otherwise minimal. A biopsy provides definitive diagnostic results. Microscopically, a peripheral giant cell granuloma is identical to its central or intraosseous counterpart, the cen- tral giant cell granuloma.
Treatment
Surgical excision is the preferred treatment for peripheral giant cell granulomas. Removal of local factors or irritants is also required. Recurrences, which are seen occasionally, are believed to be related to lack of inclusion of periosteum or periodontal ligament in the excised specimen.
Scarlet Fever
Scarlet fever is an acute exanthematous condition caused by any of three exotoxin-producing, antigenically dissimilar streptococcal strains (A, B, or C), most commonly seen be- tween 1 and 10 years of age. The characteristic effects of scarlet fever, a systemic bacterial infection, are the result of an erythrogenic toxin that causes capillary damage and that is produced most commonly by some strains of group A streptococci. Other strains of group A streptococci that are unable to produce the toxin can cause pharyngitis and all the attendant features of infection, but without the red skin rash and oral signs of scarlet fever. All group A streptococcal in- fections are generally spread through droplets from contact with an infected individual or, less likely, a carrier. Crowded living conditions promote the spread of streptococcal infec- tions, with the upper respiratory tract representing the most common portal of entry.
Clinically, children are typically affected after an incuba- tion period of several days. In addition to the usual symp- toms of all group A streptococcal infections (pharyngitis, tonsillitis, fever, lymphadenopathy, malaise, and headache) the child exhibits a red skin rash that starts on the chest and spreads to other surfaces. The face is flushed except for a zone of circumoral pallor. The palate may show nonspecific inflammatory changes, and the tongue may become covered with a white coat in which fungiform papillae are enlarged and reddened (strawberry tongue). Later, the coat is lost, leaving a beefy red tongue (red strawberry tongue or rasp- berry tongue). In untreated and uncomplicated cases, the disease subsides in a matter of days.
Penicillin is the drug of choice for the treatment of group A streptococcal infections. Erythromycin should be used in

patients allergic to penicillin. The rationale for antibiotic treatment of this short-lived, self-limited disease is the pre- vention of complications, particularly rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis.
Neoplasms
Erythroplakia
Etiology
Erythroplakia refers to a red patch on oral mucous mem- branes. It does not indicate a particular microscopic diagno- sis, although after a biopsy most cases are found to be severe dysplasia or carcinoma. The causes of this lesion are believed to be similar to those responsible for oral cancer. Therefore tobacco use probably has a significant role in the induction of many of these lesions, as does heavy alcohol consumption. Nutritional deficits and other factors may have modifying roles.
Clinical Features
Erythroplakia is seen much less commonly than its white lesion counterpart, leukoplakia. A strong association with tobacco consumption and use of alcohol has been noted. In comparison with leukoplakia, it should, however, be viewed as a more serious lesion because of the significantly higher percentage of malignancies associated with it (Box 4-1). The lesion appears as a velvety red patch with well-defined margins (Figures 4-19 and 4-20). Common sites of involve- ment include the floor of the mouth, the tongue, retromo- lar mucosa, and the soft palate. Individuals between 50 and 70 years of age are usually affected, and no gender predilec- tion is apparent. Focal white areas representing keratosis may be seen in some lesions (erythroleukoplakia). Erythro- plakia is usually supple to the touch unless the lesion is invasive, in which case induration may be noted.
Histopathology
Approximately 40% of erythroplakias show severe dysplas- tic change; about 50% are squamous cell carcinoma and 9% mild or moderate dysplasia. A relative reduction in keratin production and a relative increase in vascularity account for the clinical color of these lesions.

• Figure 4-19 Erythroplakia of the palate and alveolar ridge.
A histologic variant of carcinoma in situ exhibits changes analogous to the skin lesion called Bowen’s disease. Micro- scopic features that separate this bowenoid change from the usual carcinoma in situ include marked disordered growth, multinucleated keratinocytes, large hyperchromatic kerati- nocyte nuclei, and atypical individual cell keratinization.
Differential Diagnosis
Differential diagnosis should include Kaposi sarcoma, ecchymosis, contact allergic reaction, vascular malforma- tion, and psoriasis. The clinical history and examination should distinguish most of these lesions. A biopsy provides a definitive answer.
Treatment
The treatment of choice for erythroplakia is surgical exci- sion. Generally, it is more important to excise widely than to excise deeply in dysplastic and in situ lesions because of their superficial nature and the fact that dysplastic cells usu- ally extend beyond the clinically evident lesion. However, because epithelial changes may extend along the salivary gland and excretory ducts in the area, the deep surgical margin should not be too shallow (Figure 4-21). Several histologic sections may be necessary to adequately assess the involvement of salivary ducts.
It is generally accepted that severely dysplastic and in situ lesions eventually become invasive. Molecular biomarkers have not yet been identified to predict when (if) a lesion may undergo malignant transformation (see Chapter 2, Oral Cancer Pathogenesis). If, in fact, malignancy does develop, the conversion can range from months to years. Follow-up examinations are critical for patients with these lesions be- cause of the potential field effect and corresponding genetic and molecular alterations caused by etiologic agents.

lymphocytes, and possibly mast cells having a minor role in the genesis of these lesions. It is now accepted that a herpesvirus known as human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8), or Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV), is the etiologic agent in all forms of Kaposi sarcoma lesions, as well as in ac- quired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated body cavity lymphomas and in multicentric Castleman’s disease. This virus is believed to have a causative role in the induction and/or maintenance of Kaposi sarcoma through perturbation of focally released cytokines, growth factors, and angiogenic agents.
Clinical Features
Three different clinical patterns of Kaposi sarcoma have been described (Figures 4-22 to 4-25). Kaposi initially de- scribed the condition in 1872 as a rare skin lesion, pre- dominantly in older men living in the Mediterranean basin (Table 4-3). In this classic form, it appears as multifocal reddish-brown nodules primarily in the skin of the lower extremities, although any organ may be affected. Oral le- sions are rare in this type. This classic form has a rather long indolent course and only a fair prognosis.
• Figure 4-22 Kaposi sarcoma.
• Figure 4-23 Kaposi sarcoma of the neck.
The second pattern of Kaposi sarcoma was identified in Africa, where it is considered endemic. It is typically seen in the extremities of blacks. The most commonly affected or- gan is the skin. Oral lesions are rarely seen. The clinical course is prolonged, and the overall prognosis is only fair.
The third pattern of Kaposi sarcoma has been seen in patients with immunodeficiency status, including patients with organ transplants, and is commonly associated with a

diagnosis of AIDS (Box 4-2). This type differs from the other two forms in several ways. Skin lesions are not limited to the extremities, and they may be multifocal. Oral muco- sal and regional lymph node lesions are relatively common. Visceral organs may also be involved, and a younger age group is affected. The clinical course is relatively rapid and aggressive, and the prognosis is correspondingly poor.

AIDS, Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome; HHV8, human herpesvirus 8.
Kaposi sarcoma, once occurring in about one third of patients with AIDS, is now seen with less frequency, a shift that appears to be related to suppression of human immu- nodeficiency virus (HIV) replication by combination anti- retroviral drug therapy and concurrent improvement in CD4 lymphocyte levels. About half of AIDS-affected pa- tients with cutaneous Kaposi sarcoma develop oral lesions. Of significance is that oral lesions may be the initial site or the only site of involvement. Kaposi sarcoma has been de- scribed in most oral regions, although the palate, gingiva, and tongue seem to be the most commonly affected sites. Clinical presentation of oral Kaposi sarcoma ranges from early, rather trivial-appearing, flat lesions to late, nodular, exophytic lesions. Lesions may be single or multifocal. The color is usually red to blue. AIDS-affected patients with oral Kaposi sarcoma may have other oral problems concomi- tantly, such as candidiasis, hairy leukoplakia, advancing periodontal disease, and xerostomia.
Histopathology
Early lesions of Kaposi sarcoma may be rather subtle, being composed of hypercellular foci containing bland-appearing

lymphocytes, and mast cells are also seen in oral Kaposi sar- coma during the early and late stages of disease progression.
In instances where Kaposi sarcoma (or other vascular neoplasm) is being considered, immunohistochemical stud- ies may be beneficial. Antibodies to CD31, CD34, and factor VIII–related antigen will identify endothelial cell– derived tumors. Anti-CD34 is also useful in confirming the diagnosis of solitary fibrous tumor. A commercial antibody to the causative virus HHV8-KSHSV is available and is useful in establishing the diagnosis of Kaposi sarcoma using immunohistochemistry.
Differential Diagnosis
Clinical considerations include hemangioma, erythroplakia, melanoma, and pyogenic granuloma. Another remarkable look-alike, known as bacillary angiomatosis, mimics Kaposi sarcoma both clinically and microscopically. The causative organism is Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana. Cats are reservoirs for this organism, and fleas may be vectors. Microscopically, neutrophils and bacterial colonies are seen. This condition is cured with erythromycin or tetracycline therapy. Bacillary angiomatosis is uncommon in the skin and is very rare in oral mucous membranes.
Treatment
Of the various forms of treatment for Kaposi sarcoma, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has had the greatest effect. Other types of chemotherapy directed against angiogenesis, and cytokine pathways may also be beneficial. Surgery has been useful on localized lesions, as well as low-dose radiation and intralesional chemotherapy. Improvement in the underlying immunosuppression may help to reduce the size and number of lesions. In cases of Kaposi sarcoma associated with organ transplant–related immunosuppression and HIV disease, resolution has been achieved by alteration of the immunosuppression regimen and antiretroviral chemotherapy.
Metabolic-Endocrine Conditions
Vitamin B Deficiencies
Etiology
In various areas of the world, especially those with poor socioeconomic conditions, vitamin B deficiencies may be relatively common because of inadequate dietary intake. In the United States, deficiencies of the B vitamins are rela- tively uncommon.
Vitamin B deficiencies may involve one or several of the water-soluble B complex vitamins. Decreased intake through malnutrition associated with alcoholism, starva- tion, or fad diets may lead to clinically apparent disease. Decreased absorption resulting from gastrointestinal disease (e.g., malabsorption syndromes) or increased use because of increased demand (e.g., hyperparathyroidism) may also account for deficiencies.
Most of the vitamins classified under the B complex (biotin, nicotinamide, pantothenic acid, and thiamine) are
    
www.konkur.in
involved in intracellular metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Others (vitamin B12 and folic acid) are in- volved in erythrocyte development. Deficiencies of indi- vidual vitamins may produce distinctive clinical pictures. Significant oral changes have been well documented in de- ficiencies of riboflavin (ariboflavinosis), niacin (pellagra), folic acid (one of the megaloblastic anemias), and vitamin B12 (pernicious anemia) (see the following section).
Clinical Features
In general, oral changes associated with vitamin B deficien- cies consist of cheilitis and glossitis. The lips may exhibit cracking and fissuring that are exaggerated at the corners of the mouth, in which case the condition is called angular cheilitis. The tongue becomes reddened, with atrophy of papillae, and patients complain of pain, tenderness, and burning (Figure 4-29).
In addition to these oral changes, riboflavin deficiency results in keratitis of the eyes and a scaly dermatitis focused on the nasolabial area and genitalia. Niacin deficiency is associated with extraoral problems as well. The “four Ds” of niacin deficiency are dermatitis, diarrhea, dementia, and death. The most striking and consistent feature is a sym- metrically distributed dermatitis that eventually shows marked thickening and pigmentary changes. Dementia is seen in the form of disorientation and forgetfulness. The glossitis in this deficiency may be severe and may extend to other mucosal surfaces.
Folic acid deficiency results in a megaloblastic (enlarged RBC precursors) bone marrow, a macrocytic (enlarged cir- culating erythrocytes) anemia, and gastrointestinal abnor- malities, including diarrhea and the general oral lesions described previously. Vitamin B12 deficiency shares many of

CHAPTER 4 Red-Blue Lesions the signs and symptoms of folic acid deficiency. These are
detailed in the following sections on anemia.
Diagnosis and Treatment
Diagnosis of B complex deficiencies is based on the history, clinical findings, and laboratory data. Replacement therapy should be curative.
Pernicious Anemia
Etiology
Pernicious anemia is essentially a deficiency of vitamin B12 (erythrocyte-maturing factor or extrinsic factor). Vitamin B12 is necessary for DNA synthesis, especially in rapidly dividing cells, such as those found in bone marrow and the gastrointes- tinal tract. Pernicious anemia results from the inability to transport vitamin B12 across intestinal mucosa because of a relative lack of a gastric substance (intrinsic factor). This intrin- sic factor is normally complexed to vitamin B12, making the vitamin available to mucosal cells for absorption. An autoim- mune response directed against the intrinsic factor producing parietal cells in the gastric mucosa is believed to be the probable mechanism responsible for pernicious anemia. The end result consists of atrophic gastritis, achlorhydria, neurologic changes, megaloblastic bone marrow, and macrocytic anemia. In addi- tion, significant oral manifestations may be seen.
Clinical Features
Pernicious anemia affects adults of either gender. The clini- cal signs of anemia, weakness, pallor, shortness of breath, difficulty in breathing, and increased fatigue on exertion, may be present. In more severe cases, central nervous sys- tem manifestations (headache, dizziness, and tinnitus) and gastrointestinal manifestations (nausea, diarrhea, and stomatitis) may be noted.
Oral complaints center on the tongue, with patients re- porting pain and burning as typical symptoms. The tongue appears redder because of atrophy of the papillae. The resul- tant smooth, red appearance has been referred to as Hunter’s glossitis or Moeller’s glossitis. Angular cheilitis, oral candi- diasis, recurrent oral ulcers, and a diffuse erythematous mucositis have been noted.
Diagnosis
The clinical picture of pernicious anemia can be only pre- sumptive of this disease. Diagnosis is based on laboratory demonstration of a megaloblastic, macrocytic anemia.
Treatment
Parenteral administration of vitamin B12 is curative for this condition. Increased risk of the development of gastric car- cinoma is associated with the chronic atrophic gastritis that may occur in pernicious anemia.
Iron Deficiency Anemia
Etiology
Iron deficiency anemia is a rather common anemia caused by iron deficiency. This deficiency may be due to inadequate

dietary intake; impaired absorption caused by a gastrointes- tinal malady; chronic blood loss caused by such problems as excessive menstrual flow, gastrointestinal bleeding, or aspi- rin ingestion; and increased demand as experienced during childhood and pregnancy.
Clinical Features
This relatively prevalent form of anemia predominantly af- fects women. In addition to the clinical signs and symptoms associated with anemias in general, iron deficiency anemia may result in brittle nails and hair and koilonychia (spoon- shaped nails). The tongue may become red, painful, and smooth. Angular cheilitis may also be seen.
In addition to iron deficiency, the Plummer-Vinson (Paterson-Kelly) syndrome includes dysphagia, atrophy of the upper alimentary tract, and a predisposition to the development of oral cancer.
Diagnosis
Laboratory blood studies show slightly to moderately re- duced hematocrit and reduced hemoglobin level. The RBCs are microcytic and hypochromic. The serum iron level is also low, but the total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) is elevated.
Treatment
Recognition of the underlying cause of iron deficiency ane- mia is necessary to treat this condition effectively. Dietary iron supplements are required to elevate hemoglobin levels and replenish iron stores once an underlying cause has been defined and treated.
Burning Mouth Syndrome
This relatively common “nonlesion” clinical problem is included in this section because the symptoms associated with burning mouth also appear in patients with vitamin B deficiency, pernicious anemia, iron deficiency anemia, and chronic atrophic candidiasis. Patients with burning mouth, or burning tongue, syndrome usually exhibit no clinically detectable lesions, although symptoms of pain and burning can be intense. This is a particularly frustrating problem for both patient and clinician, because usually no clear-cut cause is evident once the previously stated conditions are ruled out, and no uniformly successful treatment is present.
Etiology
The etiology of burning mouth syndrome is varied and often is difficult to decipher clinically. Symptoms of pain and burning appear to be the result of one of many possible causes (Table 4-4). The following factors have been cited as having possible etiologic significance:
• Microorganisms—especially fungi (Candida albicans) and possibly bacteria (staphylococci, streptococci, anaerobes)
• Xerostomia associated with Sjögren’s syndrome, anxi- ety, or drugs (see Chapter 8)
• Nutritional deficiencies associated primarily with B vitamin complex or iron, and possibly zinc

• Neuropsychiatric abnormalities, such as depression, anxiety, cancer phobia, and other psychogenic problems
• Diabetes mellitus
• Mechanical trauma, such as an oral habit, chronic
denture irritation, or sharp teeth
• Idiopathic causes, including idiopathic peripheral
neuropathy
In some patients, more than one of these factors may be
contributing to the problem of burning mouth syndrome. In many others, no specific cause can be identified. Other potential etiologic factors that might be explored are those related to dysgeusia (see Chapter 8), an occasional accom- panying clinical feature of burning mouth syndrome.
The mechanism by which such a varied group of factors causes symptoms of burning mouth syndrome is com- pletely enigmatic; more attention has recently been placed on a neuropathic alteration, although a psychological etiol- ogy or component cannot be ruled out in many cases. No common thread or underlying defect seems to tie these fac- tors together. It is apparent that burning mouth syndrome occurs in a diverse group of patients, although many indi- viduals will be suffering from depression or anxiety.
Clinical Features
This condition typically affects middle-aged women. Men are affected but generally at a later age than women. Burn- ing mouth syndrome is rare in children and teenagers, very uncommon in young adults, and relatively common in adults older than 40 years of age.
Symptoms of pain and burning may be accompanied by altered taste and xerostomia. Occasionally a patient may

attribute the start of the malady to recent dental work, such as placement of a new bridge or extraction of a tooth. Symptoms are often described as severe and ever present or, more typically, as worsening late in the day and evening. Any and all mucosal regions may be affected, although the tongue is by far the most commonly involved site (Table 4-5).
Highly characteristic of the complaint of an intensely burning mouth or tongue is a completely normal-appearing oral mucosa. Tissue is intact and has the same color as the surrounding tissue, with normal distribution of tongue papillae.
Some laboratory studies that may prove useful are cul- tures for C. albicans, serum tests for Sjögren’s syndrome antibodies (SS-A, SS-B), a complete blood count, serum iron, total iron-binding capacity, and serum B12 and folic acid levels. Whether any or all of these tests should be per- formed is decided on an individual basis, depending on the clinical history and clinical suspicion.
Histopathology
Because no typical clinical lesion is associated with burning mouth syndrome, and because symptoms are more general- ized than focal, a biopsy generally is not indicated. When an occasional arbitrary site in the area of the chief com- plaint is chosen for biopsy, tissue appears within normal

Diagnosis
Diagnosis is based on a detailed history, a nondiagnostic clinical examination, laboratory studies, and exclusion of all other possible oral problems. Making the clinical diagnosis of burning mouth syndrome is generally not the difficult aspect of these cases. Rather, it is determining the subtle factor(s) that led to the symptoms that is the challenge.
Treatment
Treatment should initially involve patient reassurance of the common nature of burning mouth syndrome and the ab- sence of any serious underlying problem, particularly oral cancer, because patients frequently have a significant level of phobia about cancer. The patient’s history and examination should be reviewed along with results of hematologic and microbiological tests. If a nutritional deficit is the cause, replacement therapy is curative. If results of fungal cultures are positive, topical nystatin or clotrimazole therapy should produce satisfactory clinical results. If a patient wears a prosthetic device, its fit and tissue base should be carefully inspected. Relining or remaking the device may help elimi- nate chronic irritation or fungal overgrowth. If drug- induced xerostomia is involved, consultation with the

patient’s physician for an alternative drug may prove benefi- cial. If occlusal problems are detected, an occlusal splint may be of some benefit.
Because most patients do not fall neatly into one of these categories in which an identified problem can be rectified, treatment becomes difficult. Hormonal changes, neurologic problems, and idiopathic disease are as difficult to identify, as they are to treat. A sensitive, empathic approach should be used when treating patients with this problem. Clini- cians should be supportive and offer an explanation of the various facets and frustrations of burning mouth syndrome. No great optimism or easy solution should be offered be- cause patients ultimately may have to accept the disease and learn to live with the problem.
Other referrals may be useful, if only to exhaust all pos- sibilities and reassure patients. The need for psychological counseling is often difficult to broach with these patients, but it may be necessary after all logical avenues of investiga- tion have been explored.
Empirical treatment is often the approach most clini- cians are forced to use for patients with burning mouth syndrome. Even though there may be no evidence of candi- diasis, nystatin or clotrimazole may cause lessening of symptoms. Topical steroids, such as betamethasone (with or without antifungal agent), applied to the area of chief com- plaint may also be of some benefit. Generally, viscous lido- caine provides only temporary relief of pain, and saliva substitutes are of minimal value for patients suffering from associated (or stated) xerostomia.
Antidepressant therapy plays a major role in the manage- ment of burning mouth syndrome once other precipitating factors have been excluded. Some tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) such as doxepin have anxiolytic, antidepressant, and muscle relaxant activity and have been found to be of great benefit for many patients with burning mouth syn- drome. Unfortunately, xerostomia is a relatively frequent side effect of TCA therapy and may have to be discontin- ued. Alternatively, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), such as fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, or paroxetine, may be used. It has been suggested that SSRI preparations have fewer side effects than TCAs, in particular a less adverse ef- fect on reaction time. Recent reports have suggested a role for daily low-dose benzodiazepines such as clonazepam. However, efficacy is uncertain because the drug has not been studied in these patients in double-blind clinical trials. The management of patients with burning mouth syn- drome usually requires close coordination between the dental and the medical practitioners. For some patients, it may be necessary to seek care from a psychiatrist or a clini- cal psychologist.
Other Oral-Facial Pain Conditions
Trigeminal Neuralgia
Trigeminal neuralgia is a well-recognized condition charac- terized by sharp, stabbing pain along the distribution of the trigeminal nerve (fifth cranial nerve), with most cases dem- onstrating maxillary or second (V2) division distribution.
The condition is precipitated by touching or surface stimu- lation over a small area of the skin or mucosa innervated by a branch of this cranial nerve (so-called trigger point), re- sulting in severe episodic or paroxysmal pain.
The cause of trigeminal neuralgia is not known, although several theories have been proposed but none entirely proven. One hypothesis proposes that the condition is due to demyelination of neurons along the distribution of the trigeminal nerve, particularly at the base of the skull. Other studies have implicated arteriovenous malformations in the cerebellopontine region or beneath the trigeminal ganglion. Rarely, an accompanying organic disease such as a neoplasm within the nasopharynx, maxillary antrum, middle ear, or base of skull in close relation to the trigeminal nerve may produce symptoms attributable to trigeminal neuralgia.
Trigeminal neuralgia primarily affects older individuals, typically in the sixth and seventh decades; women are slightly more often affected than men. The condition is rare in individuals younger than 40 years of age, and symptoms attributable to trigeminal neuralgia in this younger age group should raise suspicion of an underlying systemic dis- ease, such as multiple sclerosis. The prevalence of trigeminal neuralgia in patients with multiple sclerosis is 1% to 4%.
The pain of trigeminal neuralgia is characteristically uni- lateral and limited to the anatomic pathway of one of the three main branches (V1, ophthalmic; V2, maxillary; or V3, mandibular) of the trigeminal nerve. The right side of the face is more commonly affected than the left, with very few patients having a bilateral distribution. The pain is of short duration, lasting only a matter of seconds, and may be de- scribed by the patient as “lancinating,” “shooting,” “stab- bing,” or “electric shock–like.” Sufferers may describe trig- ger spots on the skin or in the mouth, and others report that smiling, eating, or washing can bring on an attack. With untreated disease, the pain-free intervals between parox- ysms diminish, and more frequent attacks occur. Clinical and radiographic examination fails to reveal any abnormal- ity. Intraoral examination may be complicated or limited because of the patient’s fear that movement or contact with facial tissues may precipitate an attack of pain. The presence of any other neurologic signs or symptoms, such as muscle weakness or altered nerve sensation, should lead to a full neurologic assessment.
The diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia is based on clinical history and the nature of the symptoms. Although not prac- tical in all clinical settings, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans should be per- formed on any patient suspected of having trigeminal neu- ralgia to rule out organic disease, such as a space-occupying lesion at the base of the skull. Imaging or anatomic findings are absent in cases of trigeminal neuralgia.
Trigeminal neuralgia is initially managed using anticon- vulsant drugs such as carbamazepine (Tegretol). The dose needs to be titrated and is usually effective in controlling the attacks. If this fails, other medicinal therapies include phenytoin, baclofen, sodium valproate, duloxetine, prega- balin, or gabapentin. Sometimes combination therapy is
 
www.konkur.in
needed. Pharmacologic therapy sometimes fails or loses its effectiveness; then surgical treatment may have to be con- sidered. Peripheral techniques involving alcohol or glycerol rhizotomy at the level of the trigeminal ganglion are effec- tive in some cases, although symptoms may return. Stereo- tactic gamma knife radiosurgery may also be a treatment consideration, although it is not as effective as microvascu- lar decompression surgery (see later). Cryotherapy, surgical resection, radiofrequency ablation, fractional rhizotomy, and thermocoagulation have also been prescribed with varying success. Unfortunately, surgical techniques produce permanent facial anesthesia and a risk of dysesthesia, which can be troublesome to the patient. Microvascular decom- pression (MVD) is a neurosurgical procedure involving displacement of aberrant blood vessels from immediate contact with the trigeminal nerve. MVD has achieved a high success rate, but the use of this technique should be considered on an individual basis based on significant risks of morbidity or mortality.
Glossopharyngeal Neuralgia
Classically, glossopharyngeal neuralgia produces a sharp lancinating pain along the distribution of the glossopharyn- geal nerve. Symptoms are similar to those of trigeminal neuralgia, but in contrast, most cases of glossopharyngeal neuralgia are found to represent a neoplasm at the base of the tongue or in the oropharynx. Therefore, a space-occupying lesion in these regions must be excluded by careful clinical examination and imaging studies.
Clinically, the pain of glossopharyngeal neuralgia is iden- tical to that of trigeminal neuralgia, but in this condition, the severe shooting sensation is situated within the tonsillar region or oropharynx, often radiating to the ear. Swallow- ing, chewing, or coughing usually initiates pain symptoms. Diagnosis is based on clinical history and the nature of the symptoms. As with trigeminal neuralgia, the presence of organic disease, in particular, carcinoma of the oropharynx or nasopharynx or salivary gland neoplasm, should be ex- cluded by appropriate examination of the area, supple- mented with a CT scan or MRI. In addition to pain associ- ated with glossopharyngeal neuralgia, this condition may be a cause of neurally mediated syncope, with a vasovagal re- flex producing bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiac arrest.
If a space-occupying lesion has been excluded, medical management may be instituted. Carbamazepine is usually successful in controlling the pain, and additional pharma- cologic agents are available. Resolution of symptoms fol- lowing a trial course of carbamazepine in a suspected case can support the diagnosis. Surgical options may be consid- ered in cases that are unresponsive to drug therapy.
Postherpetic Neuralgia
Up to 10% of patients who have suffered recurrent varicella zoster infection of the trigeminal nerve (shingles, herpes zoster) subsequently develop a persistent neuralgia. Damage to neural tissue or persistence of virus within the trigeminal nerve ganglion have been implicated in this condition.
Symptoms occur along the dermatome previously af- fected by herpes zoster, with the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve most commonly affected in the head and neck. The character of the pain can range from episodic severe shooting pain to a constant burning sensation. The affected area may show signs of postinflammatory pigmen- tation or scarring from the preceding herpes zoster infec- tion. Pain may persist for many weeks to several months following clinical resolution of the infectious process. Diag- nosis is made on the nature of the symptoms and a previous history of shingles.
Postherpetic neuralgia is difficult to manage. Medica- tions such as TCAs, desipramine, pregabalin, and gabapen- tin may be effective in controlling pain. Some reports have shown improvement with topically applied capsaicin cream or lidocaine patch, opioids, and intrathecal methylprednis- olone, although these therapies have not been fully evalu- ated. Surgical approaches produce no benefit. Transcutane- ous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) has been found helpful in certain patients.
Giant Cell Arteritis (Temporal Arteritis)
Giant cell arteritis is a multifocal granulomatous vasculitis that was previously called temporal arteritis. The latter term was replaced because the condition was found to affect other vessels in the head or neck besides the temporal artery. If untreated, patients may develop retinal vasculitis with subsequent blindness.
Giant cell arteritis generally occurs in individuals over the age of 60 years and principally presents as unilateral head- ache-like pain in the temporal or occipital region; women are more frequently affected. It is one of the few causes of orofacial pain in which patients describe systemic upset, in- cluding weight loss, muscle weakness, and lethargy, although muscle biopsy, enzymology, and electromyography are nor- mal. It may be associated with systemic muscular and joint pain termed polymyalgia rheumatica. The pain can be initi- ated by eating, and therefore the patient can eat for only short periods before resting to allow the pain to subside. This limitation of normal eating is thought to be ischemic in ori- gin and has been misnamed jaw claudication.
Hematologic investigation shows a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and often a raised unfractionated C-reactive protein. It has been proposed that temporal ar- tery biopsy is of value in confirming the diagnosis, but granulomatous lesions occur sporadically along the vessel (skip lesions); therefore, several biopsies or analysis of a length of artery may be required to detect them. More im- portant, delay in obtaining the results of such a biopsy can be hazardous because of possible development of blindness.
Treatment consists of prednisone at a dose of 40 to 60 mg daily. After symptoms have been controlled, therapy can be reduced, although a low maintenance dose may be required for 3 to 6 months. The ESR is commonly used to monitor disease activity and to guide therapy; this should fall to normal levels (generally ,20 mm/h) following insti- tution of steroid therapy.

Red-Blue Lesions
Atypical Facial Pain
Atypical facial pain (AFP) is a chronic pain of unknown origin. Up to 50% of patients with AFP will be found to have an anxiety disorder or depression, although the nature of this relationship is unclear.
AFP predominantly affects women over the age of 30 years. This condition is a distinct clinical entity consist- ing of a constant unilateral boring or gnawing dull ache. The pain is chronic, being present every day from the time of waking until the patient goes to sleep. These symptoms do not awaken the patient from sleep, but because the condition is often associated with depression, or a sleep disturbance such as early morning waking may be present. Although poorly localized, the pain most frequently affects one side of the maxilla. Crossing of anatomic boundaries is a frequent feature; for example, the pain may cross the mid- line of the maxilla or mandible. This finding may be helpful in achieving the diagnosis because most organic pain condi- tions do not involve anatomic boundaries. Clinical exami- nation will fail to reveal any abnormality, but radiographs of the affected region must be taken to exclude dental or maxillary antral disease.
The diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical history and absence of any dental cause of the pain. A careful cranial nerve examination is required for all patients, supplemented with a CT scan or MRI to rule out organic disease or a space-occupying lesion in the base of the skull.
AFP responds well to low-dose antidepressive drug therapy such as a tricyclic antidepressant. Typically, a small dose is initiated and is gradually increased until the pain is controlled. In recent years, SSRIs have also been used in the management of this condition, but results have been mixed. All prescribed drugs require carefully monitored therapy for at least 6 months.
Atypical Odontalgia
This condition is very closely related to AFP and is likely to have a similar psychological component. Many cases have a long and complicated history of failed dental treatment, although this relationship is poorly defined.
The complaint is of a constant dull ache, which is a com- mon patient complaint. Symptoms are localized to one tooth or an edentulous area that is clinically and radio- graphically normal. Diagnosis is based on clinical history and absence of dental pathology. Similar to AFP, atypical odontalgia is managed with antidepressant therapy such as a TCA before sleep.
Immunologic Abnormalities
Plasma Cell Gingivitis
Etiology
Plasma cell gingivitis was first given the name plasma cell gingivostomatitis because of the prominent plasma cell infiltrate in the tissues affected and because of its undeter- mined origin. This condition was subsequently named allergic gingivostomatitis because many cases were linked to
chewing gum, which was believed to elicit an allergic reac- tion. When chewing gum was removed from the diet of affected patients, tissues reverted to normal in a matter of weeks. Although similar clinical lesions were noted in pa- tients who did not chew gum, clinical and microscopic evi- dence still supports an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction. A possible explanation for the appearance of this disorder in non–gum chewers might be that the disease is a reaction to an ingredient in chewing gum, such as mint or cinnamon flavoring, that might also be found in other foods.
This peculiar condition is of historical interest because it was relatively prevalent at one time but is rarely encountered today. In the early 1970s, numerous cases, all nearly identical, were seen throughout the United States. Within a few years, the phenomenon all but disappeared. Clinicians speculated that chewing gum formulas or sources of offending ingredient(s) were changed, making the product nonallergenic.
Clinical Features
This condition affects adults and occasionally children of either gender. Burning mouth, tongue, or lips is the usual complaint of patients with plasma cell gingivitis. Onset is rather sudden, and discomfort may wax and wane. This condition should not be classified with burning mouth syndrome because distinctive clinical changes are present. The attached gingiva is fiery red and is often edematous- appearing but not ulcerated; the tongue mucosa is atrophic and red; and the commissures are reddened, cracked, and fissured (Figures 4-30 and 4-31). Patients have no cervical lymphadenopathy and no systemic complaints.
Histopathology
The affected epithelium is spongiotic and is infiltrated by various types of inflammatory cells. Langerhans cells are also prominent, and apoptotic keratinocytes may occasionally be seen. The lamina propria displays prominent capillaries and is infiltrated by plasma cells of normal morphology.
Treatment
Most patients respond rather quickly to cessation of gum chewing or use of toothpastes containing cinnamic

   • Figure 4-31 A patient with plasma cell gingivitis showing angular cheilitis and fissured tongue.
aldehyde–containing flavoring agents. Failing this, careful dietary history taking is indicated in an attempt to identify an allergic source.
Drug Reactions and Contact Allergies
Allergic reactions to drugs taken systemically or used topi- cally often affect the skin but may also affect oral mucous membranes. A wide variety of agents are known to have this capacity, especially in patients who have a predisposition to the development of allergies.
The clinical appearance of allergic response in the skin includes red, erythematous lesions, an urticarial rash, or a vesiculoulcerative eruption. The same types of changes may appear in the oral mucosa. In less intense and less destruc- tive reactions, the mucosa exhibits a generalized and diffuse redness. When the tongue is the primary target, the pattern may be similar to the changes of vitamin B deficiency and anemia. (A detailed discussion on this subject can be found in Chapter 2.)
Extravascular Lesions
Petechiae and Ecchymoses
Etiology
Soft tissue hemorrhages in the form of petechiae (pinpoint size) or ecchymoses (larger than pinpoint size) appear intra- orally, generally as the result of trauma or blood disease (dyscrasia) (Box 4-3). Traumatic injury, if blood vessels are significantly damaged, can result in leakage of blood into surrounding connective tissue, producing red to purple le- sions. The types of injury are many and, among other things, are related to cheek biting, persistent and forceful coughing, fellatio, trauma from prosthetic appliances, inju- dicious hygiene procedures, and iatrogenic dental injuries.
In patients with blood dyscrasias, the presenting sign of minor trauma may also be oral red to purple petechiae or ecchymoses. Dental practitioners therefore can have a sig- nificant role in recognition of this abnormality. After ruling out a traumatic cause, clinicians should refer patients to an internist or hematologist.

All types of leukemia have the potential to produce one or more of the intraoral lesions listed in Box 4-4. In actual practice, monocytic leukemia is most often associated with oral manifestations, myelocytic leukemia (granulocyte se- ries) is next, and lymphocytic leukemia (lymphocytes) is least likely to be associated with oral signs. Acute forms of the leukemias are more likely than chronic forms to be associated with oral lesions.
Platelet and coagulation defects make up another large group of blood dyscrasias that may be responsible for pete- chiae, ecchymoses, and other intraoral manifestations. Platelet problems may be qualitative or quantitative when being de- scribed. They may be of unknown origin (idiopathic throm- bocytopenic purpura), or they may appear as a result of a wide variety of systemic factors, such as drug ingestion, infection, and immunologic disease. Hemophilia and related disorders in which clotting factors are deficient or defective are pre- dominantly hereditary and are characteristically associated with prolonged bleeding and occasional ecchymoses.
Clinical Features
The color of these lesions varies from red to blue to purple, de- pending on the age of the lesion and the degree of degradation

of the extravasated blood. Soft tissue hemorrhagic lesions usually appear in areas accessible to trauma, such as the buccal mucosa, lateral tongue surface, lips, and junction of the hard and soft palate (Figures 4-32 and 4-33). In those injuries that are related to uncomplicated trauma, a cause-and-effect relationship can usually be established after a history has been taken.
Lesions that develop as a result of blood dyscrasias may follow trivial or otherwise insignificant trauma. In addition to petechiae and ecchymoses, other clinical oral signs of blood dyscrasias include gingival enlargement (especially with monocytic leukemia), gingivitis, “spontaneous” gingi- val hemorrhage, prolonged bleeding after oral surgery, loose teeth, and mucosal ulcers.
Diagnosis
Inability to otherwise explain the appearance of any of these clinical signs is cause to suspect one of the blood dyscrasias. Gingivitis that is refractory to standard therapy should be viewed as a potential dyscrasia. The concomitant presence of lymphadenopathy, weight loss, weakness, fever, joint pain, and headache should add to the suspicion of serious systemic disease. Clinicians in this situation should see that patients are evaluated by an internist or hematologist.

Nonmelanocytic Lesions

 Pigmented oral mucosal lesions can be divided into two groups: those containing melanin and those containing other pigments. The latter would include discolorations associated with drug ingestion, metal implantation, and heavy-metal ingestion/intoxication. Breakdown products from extravascular blood due to trauma or blood dyscrasias (see Chapter 4) can also discolor oral mucosa. Pigmented lesions, which range from trivial (amalgam tattoo) to seri- ous (melanoma), can appear similar clinically, necessitating careful evaluation and biopsy.
Melanocytic Lesions
Melanocytes are melanin-producing cells that have their em- bryologic origin in the neural crest that migrate to epithelial surfaces where they reside among basal epithelial cells. Or- ganelles representing packaged granules of pigment known as melanosomes are produced by these melanocytes. Mela- nosomes are not ordinarily retained within the melanocyte itself but, rather, are delivered to surrounding keratinocytes via dendritic processes and occasionally to subjacent macro- phages. Light, hormones, and genetic constitution influ- ence the amount of pigment produced.
Melanocytes are found throughout the oral mucosa but usually go unnoticed microscopically because of their
relatively low level of pigment production (Figure 5-1). They appear clear with nonstaining cytoplasm on routine histologic sections. When actively producing pigment or when proliferating, they may be responsible for several dif- ferent entities in the oral mucous membranes, ranging from physiologic pigmentation to melanoma.
A relative of the melanocyte, the nevus cell, is responsi- ble for melanocytic nevi also known on the skin colloquially as “moles.” Nevus cells, although morphologically different from melanocytes, possess the same enzyme, tyrosinase that is responsible for conversion of tyrosine to melanin in the melanosome organelle.
Melanocytic lesions range from brown to black to blue, depending on the amount of melanin produced and the depth of the pigment relative to the surface. Generally, su- perficial pigmentation is brown, whereas more deeply lo- cated pigmentation is black to blue as a result of the Tyndall effect. Darkening of a preexisting lesion that has not been stimulated by known factors suggests that pigment cells are producing more melanin and/or invading deeper tissue.
Physiologic (Ethnic) Pigmentation
Clinical Features
Physiologic pigmentation is symmetric, persistent and does not alter normal tissue architecture, such as gingival stip- pling (Figure 5-2). This pigmentation may be seen in per- sons of any age and is without gender predilection. Often the degree of intraoral pigmentation may not correspond to the degree of cutaneous coloration. For example, a dark- skinned individual may have little gingival pigmentation or conversely a light-skinned person may have dark gingival pigmentation. Physiologic pigmentation may be found in any location, although the gingiva is the most commonly affected intraoral tissue. A related type of pigmentation, called postinflammatory pigmentation, is occasionally seen following mucosal inflammation such as mucosal injury or mucocutaneous disease (Figure 5-3). For example, some cases of lichen planus may show hyperpigmentation around the lesion as the result of postinflammatory pigmentation.
Histopathology
Physiologic pigmentation is not due to increased numbers of melanocytes, but rather to increased melanin production.

Differential Diagnosis
A clinical differential diagnosis would include smoking- associated melanosis, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, Addison’s
disease, and melanoma. Although physiologic pigmenta- tion is usually clinically diagnostic, a biopsy may be justified if clinical features are atypical.
Smoking-Associated Melanosis
Etiology and Pathogenesis
Abnormal melanin pigmentation of oral mucosa has been linked to cigarette smoking, termed smoking-associated mel- anosis or smoker’s melanosis. The pathogenesis is believed to be related to a component or components in tobacco that stimulate melanocytes. Female sex hormones likely modify this pigmentation because women (especially those taking birth control pills) are more commonly affected than men. The amount of smoking that brings this condition on varies but smoking up to nine cigarettes per day has been sufficient to produce gingival melanin deposition.
Clinical Features
The anterior labial gingiva is the region most typically affected, where brownish color can vary from subtle to obvi- ous. Palate and buccal mucosal pigmentation has been as- sociated with pipe smoking. In India, the use of smokeless tobacco forms has been linked to oral melanosis, particularly among alcoholics. In smoking-associated melanosis, the in- tensity of pigmentation is time and dose related (Figure 5-4).
Histopathology
Melanocytes show increased melanin production, as evi- denced by pigmentation of adjacent basal keratinocytes. The microscopic appearance is essentially similar to that seen in physiologic pigmentation and melanotic macules.
Differential Diagnosis
Other entities to consider before a definitive diagnosis is established are physiologic pigmentation, diffuse melanoac- anthoma, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, Addison’s disease, other systemic drugs (Box 5-1), and melanoma.
Treatment
With cessation of smoking, improvement can be expected over the course of months to a few years. Smoker’s melanosis

Oral Melanotic Macule
Clinical Features
Oral melanotic macule (or focal melanosis) is a focal pig- mented lesion that may represent (1) an intraoral freckle; (2) postinflammatory pigmentation; or (3) macules associ- ated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, Bandler syndrome, or Addison’s disease (see Box 5-1).
Melanotic macules have been described as occurring predominantly on the vermilion of the lips and gingiva, although they may appear on any mucosal surface. They are asymptomatic and have no malignant potential.
When melanotic macules (freckles) are seen in excess in an oral and perioral distribution, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and Addison’s disease should be considered (Box 5-2; Figures 5-5 to 5-8). Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is caused most commonly by mutation of the STK11/LKB1 gene located on chromosome 19. This mutation is inherited in an autosomal-dominant manner, and in addition to ephelides or melanotic macules, intestinal polyposis is present. These polyps are regarded as hamartomas without, or with very limited, neoplastic potential. They are usually found in the small intestine (jejunum) and may produce signs and symp- toms of abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, and diarrhea.

g2melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) increase as part of a negative feedback mechanism. Overproduction of both ACTH and MSH results in stimulation of melano- cytes, leading to diffuse pigmentation of the skin. Oral freckles and larger melanotic macules occur with general- ized pigmentation. Other presenting signs and symptoms of this syndrome include weakness, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension.
Pigmented macules have been described in association with three other rare syndromes. Carney’s complex includes endocrinopathies (most commonly Cushing’s syndrome) to- gether with oral, cutaneous, and cardiac myxomas inherited in an autosomal-dominant manner. The other, known as Laugier-Hunziker syndrome or phenomenon, is a rare ac- quired pigmentary disorder that presents as lip, oral, or finger macules and subungual melanocytic streaks. Pigmentation of the conjunctiva and penis has been described in patients with this syndrome. A rare condition, Bandler syndrome, may feature melanotic macules of the oral mucosa and perioral region together with hemangiomas of the small intestine.
A melanotic macule that occurs exclusively on sun- damaged skin (especially the face and hands) is known as lentigo (plural, lentigines). These lesions are characteristi- cally seen in older patients and appear as brown patches that are larger and darker than ephelides. The lesions are benign but may be cosmetically objectionable, in which case they may be treated with cryotherapy or laser vaporization.
• Figure 5-9 Melanotic macule showing melanin in basal keratino- cytes.
Histopathology
Microscopically, melanotic macules are characterized by melanin accumulation in basal keratinocytes and normal numbers of melanocytes (Figure 5-9). Melanophagocytosis (melanin present within connective tissue macrophages) is typically seen within the lamina propria.
Differential Diagnosis
These oral pigmentations must be differentiated from early superficial melanomas. They may be confused with blue nevi (palate) or amalgam tattoos. If they are numerous, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, Addison’s disease, Carney’s com- plex, Bandler syndrome, and Laugier-Hunziker syndrome may be possible clinical considerations (Box 5-3).
Treatment
A biopsy may be required to establish a definitive diagnosis of this lesion. Otherwise, no treatment is indicated.

Café-au-lait macules are discrete melanin-pigmented patches of skin that have irregular margins and a uniform brown coloration. Noted at birth or soon thereafter, they may be seen in normal children or may be a component of

a syndrome (Box 5-4). Individuals with six or more large café-au-lait macules (.0.5 cm diameter prepubertal, .1.5 cm diameter postpubertal) should be suspected of having neurofibromatosis (NF) (Figure 5-10). Two forms of this autosomal-dominant disorder are recognized: neurofi- bromatosis 1 (NF1; previously called von Recklinghausen’s disease) and neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2; formerly known as acoustic neurofibromatosis). Although some overlapping features are known, the two conditions are distinct clini- cally and genetically. NF1 is a relatively common disorder affecting 1 in 3000 individuals with approximately 50% of cases inherited and the remainder arising as the result of spontaneous new mutations. NF1 is characterized by mul- tiple neurofibromas of the skin, oral mucosa, nerves, and central nervous system, and occasionally the jaw. Axillary freckling (Crowe’s sign) accompanied by the presence of six or more of these macules are regarded as pathognomonic for the disorder. The genetic abnormality involves a tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 17q11.2 encoding for the neurofibromin protein that downregulates the func- tion of the p21ras protein. NF2 is characterized by bilateral acoustic neuromas, one or more plexiform neurofibromas, and Lisch nodules. The condition is caused by a mutation in the NF2 tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 22q12 that encodes for the merlin protein (an acronym for Moesin-Ezrin-Radixin-Like Protein) that, in turn, shows structural similarity to a series of cytoskeletal proteins.
Café-au-lait macules may be associated with Albright’s syn- drome (polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, endocrine dysfunction,
• Figure 5-10 Café-au-lait macule and freckling in patient with neurofibromatosis.
precocious puberty, café-au-lait macules), Noonan syndrome, Watson syndrome, Bloom syndrome, ring chromosome syn- dromes, and others. This sporadic disorder is considered to be strongly associated with mutation of the Gsa gene. Variants have been associated with primary biliary cirrhosis and alope- cia. The café-au-lait macules of Albright’s syndrome tend to be large and unilateral and have irregular borders.
Microscopically, café-au-lait macules are not particularly remarkable. They generally show excess amounts of melanin in basal keratinocytes and subjacent macrophages. Melano- cytes are normal in appearance and may be slightly increased in number.
Pigmented Neuroectodermal Tumor of Infancy
Etiology
Pigmented (melanotic) neuroectodermal tumor of infancy is a rare, fast-growing biphasic tumor composed of melanin containing cells and neuroblast-like cells. Similar to mela- nocytes and nevus cells, these cells have their origin in the neural crest. Historically, the tumor was called melanotic progonoma or retinal anlage tumor based on the suspected etiology of the cells.
Clinical Features
More than 90% of cases occur in children younger than one year of age. It occurs typically in the maxilla, although the mandible, epididymis, brain, and skull have been involved (Figure 5-11). This lesion usually presents as a nonulcerated and occasionally darkly pigmented mass. The latter feature is due to melanin production by tumor cells. Radiographs show an ill-defined lucency that may contain developing teeth.

• Figure 5-12 Pigmented neuroectodermal tumor of infancy. A and B, Nests of round cells with peripheral pigmented cells.
Histopathology
This neoplasm exhibits an alveolar pattern (i.e., nests of tumor cells with small amounts of intervening connective tissue) (Figure 5-12). Variably sized nests of round to oval cells are found within a well-defined connective tissue mar- gin. Cells located centrally within the neoplastic nests are dense and compact, resembling neuroendocrine cells; pe- ripheral cells are larger and often contain melanin.
Differential Diagnosis
Few other lesions are reported in this age group and in this characteristic location. Malignancies of early childhood, such as neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and “histio- cytic” tumors, might be considered. Odontogenic cysts and tumors would not be seriously considered in a differential diagnosis.
Treatment and Prognosis
This lesion has been treated with wide local surgical excision with good results. A few cases of local recurrence have been recorded; thus, close clinical follow-up after excision is rec- ommended. Recurrence may occur in 10% to 20% of cases. A malignant variant is extremely rare characterized by me- tastasis following local excision.
Melanocytic Nevus
Etiology
Nevus is a general term that may refer to any congenital lesion of various cell types or tissue types. Generally, how- ever, nevus (or mole) used without a modifier refers to a pigmented lesion composed of nevus or melanocytic cells. It is sometimes called, more specifically, melanocytic nevus, nevocellular nevus, melanocytic nevus, or pigmented nevus.
Melanocytic nevi are collections of nevus cells that are round or polygonal and are typically seen in a nested pat- tern (Figure 5-13). They may be found in epithelium or supporting connective tissue, or both. Nevus cells have been postulated to originate from cells that migrate from the neural crest to the epithelium and dermis (submucosa), or to result from altered resident melanocytes.
Clinical Features
Melanocytic nevi of the skin are common acquired papular lesions that usually appear shortly after birth and through- out childhood. Intraoral melanocytic nevi are relatively rare lesions that may occur at any age. Most oral lesions present as small (,0.5 cm) elevated papules or nodules, often non- pigmented (20%). The palate is the most commonly af- fected site. Less common sites are the buccal mucosa, labial

Histopathology
Microscopically, several subtypes are recognized (Figures 5-16 and 5-17). Classification is dependent on the location of ne- vus cells. When cells are located in the epithelium–connective tissue junction, the lesion is called a junctional nevus; when

• Figure 5-16 Intramucosal nevus. A and B, Confluent nests of pigmented nevus cells in submucosa.
cells are located in connective tissue, the lesion is called an intradermal nevus or intramucosal nevus; and when cells are located in a combination of these zones, the lesion is called a compound nevus. A fourth type of nevus, in which cells are spindle shaped and are found deep in the connective tissue, is known as blue nevus. Malignant transformation of an oral benign melanocytic nevus is highly improbable. Various ob- servations support this statement, including (1) malignant features are never seen in oral nevi, (2) oral melanomas rarely, if ever, contain preexisting nevi histologically, and (3) almost no cases of the malignant counterpart of the relatively com- mon oral blue nevus have been reported. Because oral mela- nocytic nevi can mimic melanoma clinically, all undiagnosed pigmented lesions should undergo a biopsy.
In the oral cavity, intramucosal nevi are the most com- monly seen variety, and blue nevi are the second most com- mon. Compound and junctional nevi occur relatively rarely in the oral mucosa. The so-called dysplastic nevus that is commonly seen in skin has not been observed in oral mu- cous membranes.
Differential Diagnosis
Other clinical considerations that should be included with any type of oral melanocytic nevus are melanotic macule, amalgam tattoo, and melanoma. Palatal lesions may offer a challenge in terms of a clinical diagnosis, as both pigmented nevi and mucosal melanoma most commonly are noted at

this site. Lesions of vascular origin might also be consid- ered. These include hematoma, Kaposi’s sarcoma, varix, and hemangioma. Diascopy (compression under glass) could be used to rule out the last two lesions, in which the blood is contained within a well-defined vascular system.
Treatment
Because of the infrequency with which oral nevi occur, and because of their ability to clinically mimic melanoma, all suspected oral nevi should be excised. Because they generally measure less than 1 cm, excisional biopsy is usually indicated.
Melanoacanthoma
Oral melanoacanthoma is an uncommon benign pigmented lesion characterized by a proliferation of dendritic melano- cytes (S-100, melan-A, and HMB45 positive) within an acanthotic epithelium with hyperkeratotic surface features. Lesions are usually solitary, although multifocal lesions have been described. Typically, these hyperpigmented lesions are macular to minimally elevated with a tendency for rapid growth, thus raising concern over the possibility of a malig- nant process. Lesions are typically focal and are generally found in the buccal mucosa, but may also occur in the pal- ate or gingiva. Trauma may have an etiologic role. Lesions may disappear spontaneously or subsequent to incisional biopsy. Malignant transformation has not been reported.
Melanoma
Cutaneous Melanoma
Melanomas of the skin have been increasing in frequency during the past several decades and now represent approxi- mately 2% of all cancers (excluding carcinomas of the skin). The average age at the time of diagnosis is 60 years, and is rare before 20 years of age. Geographically, cutaneous mela- noma is more common in locations closer to the Equator, where ultraviolet (UV) exposure is greater, and it is much more common in whites than in blacks and Asians. Predis- posing factors for skin lesions include extensive sun expo- sure, particularly in childhood, fair natural pigmentation, tanning bed abuse, and precursor lesions, such as congenital melanocytic nevi and dysplastic nevi.
On the skin are several melanoma subtypes, including nodu- lar melanoma, superficial spreading melanoma, acral lentigi- nous melanoma, and lentigo maligna melanoma, each having distinctive microscopic, clinical, and behavioral features. Differ- ences in clinical progression and histology are related, in large part, to recognition that all melanomas have two distinct phases of variable duration: (1) a radial or horizontal growth phase, during which malignant melanocytes spread laterally along the epidermal-dermal interface, and (2) a vertical growth phase, characterized by penetration of the dermis and subcutaneous tissues by malignant melanocytes. In nodular melanoma, the radial growth phase is generally very short compared with a longer radial growth phase in other forms of melanoma.
Surgery is the primary form of treatment, although chemo- therapy, immunotherapy, and/or radiation are utilized for patients with advanced disease. The 5-year survival rate for pa- tients with localized disease is over 98%. For patients with re- gional disease it is 60%, and for patients with advanced disease it is 15%. Newer therapies are emerging, including targeted biological immmunotherapy with the monoclonal antibody ipilimumab. This antibody blocks a functionally suppressive antigen (CTLA-4) on cytotoxic T lymphocytes and subse- quently allows the T cells to attack and destroy tumor cells.
Oral Melanoma
Melanomas of oral mucosa are fortunately rare. There ap- pears to be no racial predilection. It should be noted that in Japan the incidence of oral melanoma is relatively high when compared to the incidence of cutaneous melanoma, which is very low in this population.
Intraorally, preexisting melanosis was reported to appear before the development of some melanomas. This pigmen- tary defect, however, very likely represents an early radial growth phase of these lesions, and not benign melanosis. Two biological subtypes of oral melanoma have been identi- fied: invasive melanoma and in situ melanoma (Figures 5-18 to 5-24). The former type of oral melanoma shows an inva- sive or vertical growth pattern without significant lateral spread. The latter type features a junctional growth phase that may last months to years before entering a vertical growth phase. A third term, atypical melanocytic proliferation, has

been used in relation to oral pigmentations that are micro- scopically difficult to categorize. This designation indicates the presence of unusual numbers of melanocytes with abnor- mal morphology at the epithelium–connective tissue inter- face. The changes are not severe enough to justify the diagno- sis of melanoma. Lesions diagnosed as atypical melanocytic proliferation should be regarded as high-risk lesions, followed

Melanomas of oral mucosa are much less common than their cutaneous counterparts (Box 5-6). Of mucosal melano- mas of the head and neck, oral melanoma accounts for ap- proximately 40%. These lesions are found in adults; children are rarely affected. Oral melanomas tend to occur at a younger age than their more common sinonasal counter- parts, with most cases noted in those younger than 40 years. They have a strong predilection for the palate and gingiva, where collectively, more than 70% of cases are found.

Average time to arrival at a diagnosis is 9 months, in part because a third of oral melanomas are amelanotic in nature. Pigmentation patterns that suggest melanoma include differ- ent mixtures of color (such as brown, black, blue, and red), asymmetry, surface heterogeneity, and irregular margins.
Etiology
Not surprisingly, there is immunohistochemical evidence that mucosal melanomas exhibit abnormal expression of adhesion molecules, a phenotype that would contribute to the process of invasion. Also, overexpression of cell cycle

proteins p21 and cyclin D1 may be involved in melanoma development.
Recent molecular analyses have provided further in- sights into the etiology, pathogenesis, and classification of distinct forms of melanoma. In familial melanoma syn- dromes, germline mutations are well defined in three highly penetrant gene products: p16, p14ARF, and cyclin- dependent kinase 4 (CDK4). Variations in the melanocor- tin 1 receptor gene (MC1R), a low-penetrance gene, also increases melanoma risk and acts as a genetic modifier when cosegregating with the mutant p16 gene. Frequently in sporadic melanomas that occur on skin without chronic sun-induced damage and infrequently in oral lesions, mu- tations of the oncogene BRAF or N-RAS have been iden- tified. By contrast, melanomas occurring on sun-exposed skin generally lack mutations of these genes. Melanomas with wild-type BRAF or N-RAS frequently have increases in copy numbers of genes for CDK4 and cyclin D1 (CCND1), which are downstream components of the RAS-BRAF pathway. With comparative genomic hybrid- ization analysis, it has been shown that despite some overlapping histologic features, mucosal melanomas are genetically distinct from melanomas occurring on non– sun-exposed surfaces, such as acral lentiginous melanoma.

Pigmented Lesions
Immunohistochemistry
Melanoma, especially when amelanotic, can histologically mimic other malignancies and is often included in the his- topathologic differential diagnosis of poorly differentiated neoplasms. Three reliable antibodies that react with pro- teins expressed by melanoma are HMB45, melan-A (MART-1), and anti–S-100 protein. These reactions do not involve antigens directly linked to melanin formation, mak- ing such immunohistochemical analysis effective in distin- guishing pigment-poor melanomas from other tumors with similar microscopic appearance. Staining with these anti- bodies may be useful in locating occult tumor cells in tissue sections, aiding in evaluation of the depth of invasion and in detection of metastasis.
HMB45 reacts with an intracellular antigen in a variable number of cells in approximately 90% of melanomas. Al- though highly specific for melanoma, some nevi may be reactive. Normal melanocytes are typically nonreactive. Some nonmelanoma tumors (lymphoma, adenocarcinoma, angiomyolipoma) have also been shown to react to HMB45.
An antibody to a transmembrane protein on melanoma cells recognized by T cells (melan-A/MART-1) has been shown to be useful in the diagnosis of melanoma. Because this antigen (protein) is preserved in formalin-fixed tissue, it can be used when S-100 and HMB45 stains are equivo- cal, or in lieu of HMB45.
Differential Diagnosis
Intraorally, differential considerations include melanocytic nevus, amalgam tattoo, physiologic pigmentation, mela- notic macule, and Kaposi’s sarcoma. The history, symmetry, and uniformity of pigmentation are of significant value in differentiating these lesions. Because melanomas may ini- tially have a relatively innocuous appearance, a biopsy should be done on any area of questionable pigmentation.
Treatment and Prognosis
Surgery remains the primary mode of treatment for mela- nomas. Chemotherapy is often used, and specific kinase inhibitors (e.g., BRAF inhibitors) and immunotherapy are increasingly used as treatment adjuncts. Radiotherapy has not been fully explored as a primary treatment method, but it may have a supportive role in disease management. Treatment failures of mucosal melanomas are most com- monly linked to incomplete excision, resulting in local re- currence and distant metastasis. Regional lymph node metastases are often detected by a sentinel node biopsy; this finding affects the choice and extent of therapy. The need for wide surgical excision of in situ melanomas with a radial growth pattern is apparent from the microscopic appearance of this phenomenon.
The prognosis is based on both the histologic subtype and the depth of tumor invasion. The latter feature is a well- established prognosticator for skin lesions that has been applied to oral melanomas. Oral lesions have been found to be of considerably greater thickness (and consequently to be more advanced) than skin lesions at the time of biopsy.
After 5 years, the survival rate for patients with cutaneous melanomas is about 65%, whereas the survival rate for pa- tients with oral lesions is about 20%. Unfortunately, the survival rate for patients with oral lesions continues to de- cline after the traditional measure of 5 years. The overall poor prognosis of oral lesions compared with skin lesions may therefore be related in part to late recognition of the oral lesions; this has led to tumor invasion beyond 4 mm in a majority of oral melanoma cases at the time of diagnosis, with direct prognostic relevance. Another factor is probably the more confining and difficult treatment area of the oral cavity, which often precludes the ability to achieve wide margins. Oral lesions may be inherently biologically more aggressive than skin lesions; support for this is seen in the finding of distinct genomic profiles compared with cutane- ous melanomas. Until more lesions are subclassified and measured for depth of invasion, these questions will go unanswered.
Nonmelanocytic Lesions
Amalgam Tattoo (Focal Argyrosis)
Etiology
Amalgam tattoo, or focal argyrosis, is an iatrogenic lesion that follows traumatic soft tissue implantation of amalgam particles or passive transfer by chronic friction of mucosa against an amalgam restoration. This usually follows tooth extraction, preparation of teeth having old amalgam fillings for gold-casting restorations, or polishing of old restorations (producing an aerosol of amalgam that becomes impreg- nated in the tissues). It has been suggested that the forma- tion of soluble silver compounds may be involved in soft tissue deposits.
Clinical Features
This is the most common pigmentation of oral mucous membranes (Figures 5-25 to 5-27). These lesions would be expected in the soft tissues contiguous with teeth restored with amalgam alloy. Therefore, the most commonly affected sites are the gingiva, buccal mucosa, palate, and tongue. Because amalgam is relatively well tolerated by soft tissues,

 • Figure 5-26 Amalgam tattoo of the buccal mucosa.
• Figure 5-27 Amalgam tattoo of the gingiva as detected in a bite- wing radiograph.
• Figure 5-28 Amalgam tattoo showing pigment along collagen bundles and around vessels.
clinical signs of inflammation are rarely seen. The lesions are macular and gray and do not change appreciably over time. If the amalgam particles are of sufficient size, they may be detected on soft tissue radiographs.
Histopathology
Microscopically, the silver in amalgam stains collagen and elastic fibers, typically imparting them with a black or golden brown color (Figure 5-28). Few lymphocytes and macrophages are found, except in cases in which particles are relatively large. Multinucleated foreign body giant cells containing amalgam particles may be seen.
Differential Diagnosis
The significance of the amalgam tattoo lies in its clinical similarity to melanin-producing lesions. In a gingival or a palatal location, separation from nevi and, more important, early melanoma is mandatory, because these are the most common areas for the latter lesions as well. Radiographs, the history, and an even, persistent gray appearance would help to separate amalgam tattoo from melanoma. Any ques- tionable lesions should undergo a biopsy.
Drug-Induced Pigmentations
Tetracycline-associated pigmentation may be found after the treatment of acne with prolonged high doses of mino- cycline (Figure 5-29). Diffuse skin pigmentation may be seen in sun-exposed areas, apparently as a result of increased melanin production, or focal pigment deposits may be seen in the legs and periorbital skin, apparently as a result of drug complexes in melanocytes. Pigmentation of the gin- giva and palate is due to increased amounts of melanin and probably deposits of drug (or drug bound to melanin) in bone and tooth roots.
Other exogenous drugs that may produce pigmentation of oral tissues (Box 5-7) include aminoquinolines (e.g., chloroquine), cyclophosphamide, amiodarone, zidovudine (azidothymidine [AZT]), quinacrine, clofazimine, and heavy metal–containing compounds (Figures 5-30 and 5-31). Oral pigmentation has also been described in patients on hormone

replacement therapy (conjugated estrogens [Premarin]). Azido- thymidine (AZT), which is used in the treatment of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), may cause nail pigmen- tation, in addition to mucosal pigmentation.
Heavy-Metal Pigmentations
Etiology
Some heavy metals (arsenic, bismuth, platinum, lead, and mercury) may be responsible for oral pigmentation. This phe- nomenon occurs predominantly after occupational exposure to vapors of these metals. Historically, arsenic and bismuth compounds were used to treat diseases such as syphilis, lichen planus, parasitic infections, and other dermatoses, providing another method for oral heavy-metal deposition. Cisplati- num, the salt of the heavy metal, has antineoplastic activity and is used to treat some malignancies. The side effect of a gingival platinum line has been described within this context.
Clinical Features
These heavy metals may be deposited in both skin and oral mucosa (especially in the gingiva). The characteristic color is gray to black, and the distribution is linear when found along the gingival margin (Figure 5-32). Bismuth and lead staining of gingival tissues is known as a bismuth line and a lead line, respectively. This staining is proportional to the
• Figure 5-32 Lead pigmentation of the gingival margins.
amount of gingival inflammation and appears to be a result of the reaction of the heavy metal with bacterially produced hydrogen sulfide in inflammatory zones.
Significance
Metallic deposits in oral mucosa, per se, are relatively insig- nificant. The underlying cause must be investigated because of the detrimental effects of systemic toxicity. For dental personnel, chronic mercury vapor exposure is now recog- nized as a significant occupational hazard if dental amalgam is handled carelessly and without proper precautions. Den- tal patients, however, are apparently at no risk because of the relatively short exposure periods that they experience with routine office visits. Toxicity from the restorations themselves is apparently negligible.
If, in the dental office, the atmospheric air has elevated mer- cury vapor levels, dental personnel may show elevated body levels of mercury as measured in the hair, nails, saliva, and urine. Chronic mercury intoxication may produce symptoms of trem- ors, loss of appetite, nausea, depression, headache, fatigue, weakness, and insomnia. Hazards from mercury can be elimi- nated in the dental office if precautions are observed. The most common recommendations include (1) storage of mercury in sealed containers; (2) coverage of mercury spills with sulfur dust to prevent vaporization; (3) use of hard, seamless floor surfaces instead of carpeting; (4) working in well-ventilated spaces with frequent air filter changes; (5) storage of amalgam scraps under water in a sealed container; (6) use of well-sealed amalgam cap- sules; and (7) use of water spray and suction when grinding amalgam.

Squamous Papilloma/Oral Wart
Oral squamous papilloma is a generic term that is used to include papillary and verrucous growths composed of benign epithelium and minor amounts of supporting con­ nective tissue. Oral squamous papilloma (including those of the vermilion portion of the lip) is the most common papil­ lary lesion of the oral mucosa and accounts for approxi­ mately 2.5% of all oral lesions. Similar to verruca vulgaris (warts) on the skin, many oral squamous papillomas have been shown to be associated with the human papilloma­ virus (HPV). The type of HPV varies, with some cases having the same subtype as cutaneous warts and others containing different HPV strains. Whether all oral papillomas are of viral origin is unresolved. It has been shown that the class of HPVs is very large (more than 100 subtypes), and that in­ dividually these viruses are associated with many prolifera­ tive conditions of squamous epithelium. For example, HPV subtypes 2, 4, 7, and 22 have been demonstrated within cutaneous warts; flat warts of the skin have been associated with HPV subtypes 3, 8, and 10. HPV subtype 11 has been found within papillomas of the sinonasal tract and the oral cavity. HPV subtypes 16 and 18 have been related to neo­ plastic changes of cervical squamous epithelium and to oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (Table 6­1).
Etiology
HPV, the putative etiologic agent of papillomas of the upper aerodigestive tract, is a member of the papovavirus group. It is a DNA virus containing a single molecule of double­stranded DNA comprising approximately 8000 nucleotide base pairs. The viruses themselves are nonenveloped icosahedral particles ranging from 45 to 55 nm in diameter with 72 capsomeres in a skewed arrangement. Various species are antigenically dis­ tinct but share some common antigenic determinants. HPV specifically infects basal epithelial cells and establishes produc­ tive infection only in the stratified squamous epithelium of the skin and mucosa. Replication of HPV occurs within the nuclei of epithelial cells with the viral genome expressed in both early and late stages. Nononcogenic HPV­types that re­ sult in benign epithelial proliferations contain the virus in an episomal state in contrast to oncogenic HPV­types where there is viral integration into host DNA.
Clinical Features
Oral squamous papillomas may be found on the vermilion portion of the lips and on any intraoral mucosal site. The hard and soft palate and the uvula (Box 6­1; Figures 6­1 to 6­3) account for approximately one third of all lesions. Squamous papillomas generally measure less than 1cm in greatest dimension, appearing clinically as asymptomatic, pink to white exophytic granular or cauliflower­like surface alterations. Solitary lesions are most common, although multiple concurrent squamous papillomas may occur.
In the setting of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, oral warts are common, particularly in patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Lesions tend to be multiple, ranging from flat­topped plaques to verruciform or cauliflower­shaped exophytic masses.
Histopathology
Oral squamous papillomas represent an exaggerated growth of benign squamous epithelium (Figures 6­4 to 6­6). The lesions are exophytic composed of finger­like extensions of epithelium, supported by a well­vascularized connective tis­ sue core. The histologic architecture may mimic the pattern of the cutaneous wart. Upper level epithelial cells demon­ strate nuclei that are pyknotic (condensed) and crenated (resembling a raisin), often surrounded by an edematous or

Differential Diagnosis
The differential diagnosis of oral squamous papilloma, when solitary, includes verruciform xanthoma, papillary hyperplasia, and condyloma acuminatum. Verruciform xanthoma may resemble squamous papilloma, although this lesion has a distinct predilection for the gingiva and the alveolar ridge and contains xanthoma cells (macrophages with a bubbly appearing cytoplasm, so­called foamy macro­ phages) in the connective tissue papillae. Inflammatory papillary hyperplasia usually occurs on the hard palate un­ derneath a poorly fitting denture, and is not associated with a viral infectious process. Condyloma acuminatum (ano­ genital wart) would be larger than the papilloma, with a broader base, and would appear pink to red as a result of comparatively less keratinization.
Treatment and Prognosis
Although many oral squamous papillomas appear to be virally induced, the infectivity of the HPV is low. The route of trans­ mission of the virus is unknown for oral lesions, although di­ rect contact in an area of local trauma would be favored.
Removal by surgical excision is the treatment of choice. Laser ablation is also effective but does not offer the oppor­ tunity for microscopic examination of the lesion to confirm the diagnosis. Recurrence is uncommon, except for lesions in patients infected with HIV.

CHAPTER 6
Verrucal-Papillary Lesions
 Papillary Hyperplasia
Etiology
Papillary hyperplasia (palatal papillomatosis, papilliferous hyperplasia) appears almost exclusively on the hard palate and almost always in association with a removable prosthe­ sis. The precise cause of papillary hyperplasia is not well understood, although it appears to be associated with an ill­ fitting or loose denture that creates a potential space between the denture base and tissue, predisposing to or potentiating growth of Candida albicans organisms. Tissue hyperplasia has been related to the presence of the fungal organism in the setting of low­grade chronic trauma. Despite the name, papillary hyperplasia is not associated with HPV infection.
Clinical Features
The mucosa of the palatal vault is most commonly involved and less commonly the alveolar ridge or the palatal incline (Figure 6­8). Presentation is characterized by multiple ery­ thematous and edematous papillary projections that are tightly aggregated, producing an overall verrucous, granu­ lar, or cobblestone appearance. The projections may be slender and almost villous, although in most cases, each projection tends to be rounded and blunted, with narrow spaces on either side. Ulceration is rare, although intense erythema may at times provide an overall appearance of erosion. Focal telangiectatic sites may also be noted on occasion.
Histopathology
On perpendicular cross­section, papillary hyperplasia appears as numerous small exophytic fronds or papillary projections covered with intact parakeratotic stratified squamous epithelium (Figure 6­9). The epithelium is sup­ ported by hyperplastic central cores of well­vascularized stromal tissue. The epithelium is hyperplastic and often demonstrates pseudoepitheliomatous features, occasionally severe enough to mimic squamous cell carcinoma. No evi­ dence of dysplasia is found in association with this lesion and risk of malignant transformation is not increased.
• Figure 6-8 Papillary hyperplasia.
• Figure 6-9 Papillary hyperplasia. Note pseudoepitheliomatous pattern.
Differential Diagnosis
The range of possibilities in the differential diagnosis of papillary hyperplasia of the palate is limited because it is seldom confused with other forms of pathology. The chief lesion to be separated from papillary hyperplasia is nicotine stomatitis involving the hard palate; however, nicotine sto­ matitis does not occur on the hard palate of those who wear complete maxillary removable appliances. Also, nicotine stomatitis tends to be more keratinized and usually demon­ strates the presence of a small red dot or punctum in the center of each nodular excrescence, which represents the orifice of the subjacent minor salivary gland duct. Rarely, in Darier’s disease, the mucosa of the palate may demonstrate numerous papules. Numerous squamous papillomas may occur on the palate; however, these lesions tend to be more keratinized with more delicate projections. In the so­called malignant form or neoplasia­associated type of acanthosis nigricans, oral lesions are papillary in nature and may re­ gress relative to the treatment response of the underlying distant malignancy. Finally, in the multiple hamartoma syndrome (Cowden’s syndrome), the oral mucosa may ex­ hibit numerous papillary mucosal nodules. These nodules, composed of benign fibroepithelial proliferations, may im­ part a cobblestone appearance, usually to the tongue, buccal mucosa, and gingiva. Affected patients usually have other stigmata of the syndrome, including hamartomatous pap­ ules of the skin, benign and malignant breast lesions, and malignancies of the thyroid and kidney.
Treatment and Prognosis
Surgical removal is indicated before a denture is recon­ structed for the patient. The actual surgical method is often a matter of individual preference and may include curettage, cryosurgery, electrosurgery, microabrasion, or laser ablation.
Removal of appliances at bedtime and soaking in a weak disinfecting or antifungal medium, as well as maintenance of good oral hygiene coupled with topical antifungal therapy, may significantly reduce the intensity of lesions. In mild cases, the use of soft tissue conditioning agents and liners, with frequent changes of the lining material, can produce sufficient resolution to preclude surgery. Topical antifungal ointment, alone or mixed with a corticosteroid ointment,

may help reduce the size and intensity of the lesions, al­ though it will not result in a complete cure when used alone.
Condyloma Latum
Condyloma lata is one of the many and varied expressions of secondary syphilis. As with all forms of syphilis, cutane­ ous, mucosal, and systemic lesions that mimic other condi­ tions or diseases can be seen. Characteristic of condyloma latum is the presence of exophytic, sometimes friable, papil­ lary to polypoid lesions within the oral cavity. Condyloma latum contains abundant microorganisms (Treponema pal- lidum), making it potentially infectious.
Condyloma latum usually appears on the skin, especially in the perianal and genital areas. Lesions may also be noted within the oral cavity and the lips where they form a soft, red, often mushroom­like mass with a generally smooth, lobulated surface.
Microscopically, the overlying epithelium demonstrates significant acanthosis, intracellular and intercellular edema, and transmigration of neutrophils. A dense perivascular plasma cell infiltrate is common within the lamina propria in the absence of a true vasculitis.
Patients require systemic administration of antibiotics to eliminate the underlying bacteremia. The oral lesions gener­ ally regress as the systemic disease is brought under control.
Condyloma Acuminatum
Condyloma acuminatum is an anogenital wart caused by HPV that may also involve the oral mucosa. Common to these sites is a warm, moist squamous epithelial surface. There is an increased incidence in HIV­infected patients, reflecting an aspect of opportunistic infection.
Etiology and Pathogenesis
Condyloma acuminatum is a verrucous or papillary growth of the skin or mucosa. More than 90% of cases are caused by the nononcogenic HPV subtypes 6 and 11. The virus is spread through direct skin­to­skin or skin­to­mucosa con­ tact during sex with an infected partner.
Clinical Features
Characteristic of early condyloma acuminatum formation is a group of numerous pink nodules that grow and ultimately coalesce (Figure 6­10). The result is a soft, broad­based, exophytic papillary growth that may be keratinized or non­ keratinized.
In 1 to 3 months after viral implantation, the disease becomes apparent. The lesions at times may be rather exten­ sive, but they are generally self­limiting. Autoinoculation is a possible risk, thus offering a rationale for complete elimi­ nation of the lesions.
Histopathology
Papillary projections extending from the base of each le­ sion are covered by stratified squamous epithelium that is often parakeratotic but at times may be nonkeratinized. Koilocytosis of upper level epithelial cells is usually
• Figure 6-10 Condyloma acuminatum.
found. The epithelial layer itself is hyperplastic without evidence of dysplastic change. The underlying stroma is well vascularized and may contain a trace of chronic inflammatory cells.
Differential Diagnosis
In some cases, condyloma acuminatum may resemble focal epithelial hyperplasia (Heck’s disease). Multiple intraoral warts (verruca vulgaris) may be a consideration and indeed represent a similar type of infection caused by HPV. Al­ though condyloma acuminata tend to show more parakera­ tosis and acanthosis than verruca vulgaris, no universally accepted microscopic features can be used to reliably sepa­ rate the two. DNA hybridization studies may be required to classify these lesions accurately.
Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for these lesions is generally surgical excision that may consist of cryosurgery, scalpel excision, electrodesicca­ tion, or laser ablation. There is no antiviral treatment avail­ able. Recurrences are common and perhaps are related to surrounding normal­appearing tissue that may be harbor­ ing the infectious agent.
Focal Epithelial Hyperplasia
Focal epithelial hyperplasia (Heck’s disease) was identified as a distinct entity in 1965 by two different groups. Early studies described lesions in Native Americans in both the United States and Brazil, and in the Inuits of Greenland. More recent studies have identified lesions in other popula­ tions and ethnic groups from South Africa, Mexico, and Central America, and clinical experience has demonstrated a wide ethnic incidence.
Etiology and Pathogenesis
Factors ranging from local low­grade irritation to vitamin deficiencies have been proposed as the cause of this condition. A viral etiology was postulated based on the patterns of spread in Greenland long before molecular evidence of HPV infec­ tion was established. There is now convincing evidence that HPV subtypes 13 and 32 have been consistently associated
  
www.konkur.in
with focal epithelial hyperplasia. Initially, there were sugges­ tions that genetic factors are involved but this has not been substantiated.
Clinical Features
Focal epithelial hyperplasia is characterized by the pres­ ence of numerous nodular soft tissue masses distributed over the mucosal surfaces, especially the buccal mucosa, labial mucosa, tongue, and gingiva (Figures 6­11 and 6­12). Lesions may appear as discrete or clustered papules, often similar in color to the surrounding mucosa. If found in areas of occlusal trauma, lesions may appear whitish because of keratinization. The lesions are asymptomatic and are often discovered incidentally. Initially described in children, this condition is now known to affect patients in a wide age range. An equal gender distribution has been noted. In HIV­positive individuals receiving HAART, a multifocal distribution of lesions may be noted.
Histopathology
Acanthosis and parakeratosis are consistent findings. Prominent clubbing and fusion of epithelial ridges are also seen. Enlarged ballooning cells with abnormal nuclear chromatin patterns are often seen within the
• Figure 6-11 Focal epithelial hyperplasia of the lip.
• Figure 6-12 Focal epithelial hyperplasia of the buccal mucosa.
spinous layer. More superficial elements demonstrate cy­ toplasmic granular changes and nuclear fragmentation. Cells immediately beneath the surface often show pyk­ notic nuclei with a surrounding clear zone. So­called mitosoid bodies, degenerating keratinocytes that simulate cells in mitoses, can be identified.
Ultrastructurally, crystalline arrangements of virus­like particles may be noted. Such particles, which are located within the superficial spinous cells, measure approximately 50 nm in diameter. Viruses may be found within the nu­ cleus, as well as in the cytoplasm of spinous layer cells.
Differential Diagnosis
A differential diagnosis would include verruca vulgaris and multiple squamous papillomas. The oral mucosal lesions of Cowden’s (multiple hamartoma) syndrome may present similarly and should be ruled out. In addition, oral mani­ festations of Crohn’s disease and pyostomatitis vegetans might be considered.
Treatment
No particular treatment is indicated, especially with wide­ spread involvement. Surgical removal may be used if few lesions are present; laser ablation may also be used. Of sig­ nificance is that spontaneous regression has been noted in many cases, perhaps as an expression of viral recognition and cell­mediated immunity.
Neoplasms
Keratoacanthoma
Etiology
Keratoacanthoma is a form of squamous cell carcinoma that involutes in the majority of cases. Persistence of a lesion thought to be a keratoacanthoma should trigger reevaluation. Keratoacanthoma occurs chiefly on sun­ exposed skin and, far less commonly, at the mucocutane­ ous junction, but lesions purported to represent keratoac­ anthoma have been described very rarely on mucous membranes. On the skin, keratoacanthomas originate within the pilosebaceous apparatus, which explains the predominance of this lesion there. It has been suggested that ectopic sebaceous glands may represent the site of origin intraorally. Virus­like intranuclear inclusions have been described in keratoacanthoma but there is no evi­ dence that Merkel cell polyoma virus is involved. At­ tempts to produce such lesions in experimental animals by inoculation of tumor tissue have been unsuccessful. However, a rabbit skin model of keratoacanthoma was developed using topical carcinogens. Between 15% and 30% of melanoma patients treated with BRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib and dabrafenib develop cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and keratoacanthomas within the first few weeks of therapy. Some studies have sug­ gested that BRAF inhibitors drive paradoxical activation of the mitogen­activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in patients harboring H­ras mutations.

  • Figure 6-13 Keratoacanthoma of the upper lip. (Reproduced with permission from Regezi JA, Sciubba JJ, Pogrel MA: Atlas of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology. Philadelphia, 2000, WB Saunders, Figure 4-13.)
Clinical Features
Keratoacanthoma may be solitary or multiple (Figure 6­13). The lesion usually begins as a small red macule that soon becomes a firm papule with a fine scale over its highest point. Rapid enlargement of the papule occurs over ap­ proximately 4 to 8 weeks, resulting ultimately in a hemi­ spheric, firm, elevated, asymptomatic nodule. When fully developed, a keratoacanthoma contains a core of keratin surrounded by a concentric collar of raised skin or mucosa. A peripheral rim of erythema at the base of the lesion may parallel the raised margin. Multiple keratoacanthomas are a feature of the Muir­Torre syndrome, an autosomal­ dominant skin condition of genetic origin characterized by cutaneous tumors of the sebaceous gland and visceral malignant diseases.
If the lesion is not removed, spontaneous regression occurs. The central keratin mass is exfoliated, leaving a cup­ shaped lesion that heals with superficial scar formation.
Histopathology
Keratoacanthoma is characterized by a central keratin plug with an overhanging lip or a marginal buttress of epithe­ lium (Figure 6­14). Marked pseudoepitheliomatous hyper­ plasia is evident, along with an intense mixed inflammatory infiltrate.
The histologic similarity between a keratoacanthoma and a well­differentiated squamous cell carcinoma is of great importance. Numerous histologic criteria, such as a high level of differentiation, the formation of keratin masses, smooth symmetric infiltration, abrupt epithelial changes at lateral margins, and transepidermal elimination of sun­damaged elastic fibers, have been used to distinguish keratoacanthoma from carcinoma. Differences in telomer­ ase activity, COX­2 and p53 expression in addition to EGFR and myc gene copy number provide evidence that at least some keratoacanthomas and squamous cell carcinomas may be distinct.
•Figure6-14 Keratoacanthoma.Notethe“cup-shaped”symmetry and verruciform surface.
Differential Diagnosis
The primary entity to be distinguished from a solitary keratoacanthoma, from both a clinical and a microscopic perspective, is squamous cell carcinoma. Squamous cell car­ cinomas have a relatively slow growth rate, are of irregular shape, and generally begin later in life. For lesions on the lip, other conditions to be differentiated include molluscum contagiosum, solar keratosis, and verruca vulgaris. Most of these entities, however, can be easily excluded on the basis of histologic examination of the biopsy specimen.
Treatment and Prognosis
At the least, a very careful follow­up is required in all cases because of difficulties in diagnosis and distinction from squamous cell carcinoma. Any dubious lesion should be treated because no absolutely reliable diagnostic, clinical, or histologic criteria are known to differentiate these two le­ sions. In addition, during the early phase of this lesion, prediction of its ultimate size may be impossible.
A solitary keratoacanthoma may be removed by surgical excision or by thorough curettage of the base; both methods are equally effective. Recently the use of intralesional meth­ otrexate has been suggested in specific clinical circum­ stances. No recurrence is expected. In cases in which no treatment is provided, spontaneous involution, often with scar formation, is seen.
Verrucous Carcinoma
Etiology
Verrucous carcinoma of oral mucous membranes (Box 6­3) was separated from typical oral squamous cell carcinoma in 1948 by Lauren Ackerman and is most closely associated with the use of tobacco in various forms, especially smokeless tobacco. Although oncogenic HPV has long been suspected to play a role in the development of verrucous carcinoma, studies using a variety of molecular methods have failed to establish a definitive relationship.
Clinical Features
This form of cancer accounts for 5% of all intraoral squa­ mous cell carcinomas (Figures 6­15 to 6­18). The buccal

mucosa is the location for more than half of all cases, with the gingiva involved in nearly one third of cases. The mandibular gingiva shows a slight predominance over the maxillary gingiva. A distinct male predominance has been noted, and most affected individuals are over 50 years of age.
Early lesions are relatively superficial, tend to appear white and corrugated clinically, and may be initially inter­ preted as verrucous hyperplasia. These lesions may arise in
• Figure 6-17 Verrucous carcinoma of the tongue.
• Figure 6-18 Verrucous carcinoma of the lingual gingiva. (Repro- duced with permission from Regezi JA, Sciubba JJ, Pogrel MA: Atlas of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology. Philadelphia, 2000, WB Saunders, Figure 4-16.)
typical leukoplakia as well as proliferative verrucous leu­ koplakia. In time, the lesion borders become irregular and indurated. As verrucous carcinoma develops, the lesion becomes exophytic with a whitish to gray shaggy surface. Although not highly infiltrative, the lesion pushes into surrounding tissues. When it involves the gingival tissues, it becomes fixed to the underlying periosteum. If it is un­ treated, gradual invasion of periosteum and destruction of bone occur.
Histopathology
At low magnification, surface papillary fronds are covered by a markedly acanthotic and highly keratinized epithelial surface. Bulbous, well­differentiated epithelial masses ex­ tend into the submucosa, with margins that are blunted and pushing (Figures 6­19 and 6­20). Adjacent to the pushing margins of the carcinoma is a lymphocytic infiltrate. Focal areas of acute inflammation surrounding foci of well­ formed keratin are seen occasionally.
The deceptively benign microscopic pattern and the ab­ sence of significant cellular atypia are important. Diagnosis can be made only with a biopsy specimen of sufficient size

to include the full thickness of the epithelial component, as well as the supporting connective tissue.
Papillary squamous cell carcinoma is a form of carcinoma that has some microscopic resemblance to verrucous carci­ noma (Figure 6­21). It exhibits a papillary profile, is moder­ ately to well differentiated, and may arise in the setting of proliferative verrucous leukoplakia (PVL) (see also Chapter 3).
Differential Diagnosis
In well­developed cases of verrucous carcinoma, the clinical pathologic diagnosis is relatively straightforward. However, in less than obvious situations, leukoplakia might be a clinical consideration. A differential diagnosis would also include papillary squamous carcinoma, which may be dis­ tinguished from verrucous carcinoma by its more infiltra­ tive nature, its greater degree of cytologic atypia, and its more rapid growth. Verrucous carcinoma may develop from preexisting (and usually multiple) leukoplakia, representing part of the spectrum of PVL (Box 6­4; Figures 6­22 to 6­27) (see also Chapter 3).
Treatment and Prognosis
Surgical methods are generally used as the primary form of therapy in most cases of verrucous carcinoma. This occurs

primarily because of early reports of dedifferentiation seen in verrucous carcinoma after radiotherapy. The literature, however, now suggests that transformation to squamous cell carcinoma following radiotherapy occurs far less commonly than has been previously reported. Aggressive radiotherapy early, or in combination, with surgery may be a viable alter­ native treatment method.
Verrucous carcinoma rarely metastasizes, although it is locally destructive. In advanced cases in which the maxilla or the mandible exhibits significant destruction, resection may be necessary.
The prognosis for verrucous carcinoma is excellent, pri­ marily because of its high level of differentiation and rarity of metastatic spread. Local recurrence, however, remains a distinct possibility if inadequate treatment is rendered.

disease, lesions were confined to the oral mucosa only. The cause of pyostomatitis vegetans is unknown, although it may be seen in association with ulcerative colitis, spastic colitis, chronic diarrhea, and Crohn’s disease. More than 25% of cases are not associated with gastrointestinal disturbances.
Clinical Features
Early in the evolution of pyostomatitis vegetans, the oral mucosa (especially the buccal mucosa) appears erythematous,
edematous, nodular, and occasionally fissured (Figure 6­28). Numerous tiny yellow pustules, ranging from 2 to 3 mm in diameter, and small vegetating papillary projections may be seen over the surface of friable mucosa. Oral mucosal involve­ ment may include the gingiva, hard and soft palate, buccal and labial mucosa, lateral and ventral aspects of the tongue, and floor of the mouth. Men are affected nearly twice as of­ ten as women, and the age range is generally between the third and sixth decades, with an average age of 34 years. Laboratory values may be within normal limits, but in most patients, peripheral eosinophilia or anemia is noted.
Histopathology
The oral mucosa demonstrates hyperkeratosis and pro­ nounced acanthosis, often with a papillary surface or with pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia (Figure 6­29). A pro­ nounced inflammatory infiltrate composed of neutrophils and eosinophils is a constant finding. Superficial abscesses may be seen within the lamina propria, with extension into the parabasal regions of the overlying epithelium. Ulcer­ ation and superficial epithelial necrosis may be observed.
Treatment and Prognosis
Management of this entity relates to controlling the associ­ ated bowel disease. Topical agents, such as corticosteroids,

may be used intraorally. In addition, antibiotics, multivita­ mins, and nutritional supplements may be given; however, all are associated with variable results. Remission of oral le­ sions occurs when underlying bowel disease is medically controlled.
Verruciform Xanthoma
Verruciform xanthoma is an uncommon, benign oral mu­ cosal lesion that occasionally may be found on the skin, typically on the genitalia. The cause is unknown, although missense mutations in exon 6 of the 3 beta­hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (NSDHL) gene have been reported in soli­ tary verruciform xanthoma. Mutations in this gene, con­ fined within exons 4 and 6, have been reported in multiple syndromic verruciform xanthomas.
Clinical Features
Clinically, verruciform xanthoma is well circumscribed, with a granular to papillary surface (Figure 6­30). The size of this lesion ranges from 2 mm to more than 2 cm. An exophytic or depressed surface is present, and the lesion may occasionally be ulcerated. The level of keratinization of the surface influences the color, which ranges from white to red.
Most cases have been reported in whites, and no gender predilection has been noted. The average age of patients is 45 years, although a few cases have been reported within the first and second decades. The lesions are usually discovered incidentally.
Histopathology
The architecture of the lesion is flat or slightly raised, with a papillomatous or verrucous surface composed of parakera­ tinized epithelial cells (see Figure 6­30). Uniformly invagi­ nated crypts alternate with papillary extensions. Elongated epithelial ridges extend into the lamina propria at a uniform depth. The epithelial component is normal, with no evidence of dysplasia or atypia.
Numerous foam or xanthoma cells are found within the lamina propria or connective tissue papillae. Characteristic of the foam cells is a granular to flocculent cytoplasm that may
contain periodic acid–Schiff (PAS)­positive, diastase­resistant granules or lipid droplets, or both. Immunohistochemical markers of value include CD68 and CD163, which identify the foam cells to be of monocyte/macrophage lineage.
Differential Diagnosis
A differential diagnosis for this entity would include squa­ mous papilloma, papillary squamous carcinoma, verrucous carcinoma and condyloma acuminatum.
Treatment
Treatment consists of conservative excision. No recurrences have been reported.

 Connective tissue lesions comprise a large and diverse number of entities ranging from reactive conditions to neoplasms. Reactive conditions are derived from mesenchy- mal cells and are represented by fibrous hyperplasias or exuberant proliferations of granulation tissue. Tumors of con- nective tissue elements are a heterogeneous and complex col- lection of diseases. Prediction of biological behavior from histology alone is problematic and is reflected in the difficul- ties in grading individual tumors. Traditionally, tumors of connective tissues have been classified on a model of pre- sumed histogenetic lineage thus subdividing into tumors of fibrous, fibrohistiocytic, myofibroblastic, vascular, neural,
muscular, adipose, and other types of tissue. Increasingly, it is becoming evident that many tumors do not arise from their mature, differentiated counterparts, because soft tissue tumors can arise in sites that are devoid of their mature tissue coun- terpart. For example, liposarcomas often arise at sites where no adipose tissue is present, and rhabdomyosarcomas often arise at sites that contain no striated muscle. It is likely that soft tissue tumors arise from primitive progenitor cells that can develop along any differentiation pathway that is dictated by the expression of specific differentiation genes. However, for the purposes of describing these entities, a more traditional histogenetic classification has been maintained here.

Connective Tissue Lesions
Fibrous Lesions
Reactive Hyperplasias
Reactive hyperplasias comprise a group of fibrous connective tissue lesions that commonly occur in oral mucosa second- ary to injury. They represent a chronic process in which exu- berant repair (granulation tissue and scar) follows injury. As a group, these conditions present as submucosal masses that may become secondarily ulcerated when traumatized such as during mastication. Their color ranges from lighter than the surrounding tissue (because of a relative reduction in vascu- larity and increase in collagen) to red (because of an abun- dance of well-vascularized granulation tissue). Because nerve tissue does not proliferate with reactive hyperplastic tissue, these lesions are painless. The reason for the exuberant repair is unknown. Treatment generally consists of surgical excision and removal of the irritating factor(s).
Although these lesions are all pathogenically related, different names or subdivisions have been devised because of variations in the anatomic site, clinical appearance, or microscopic picture. Those lesions that present as promi- nent red masses are discussed in Chapter 4.
Peripheral Fibroma
Clinical Features
By definition, peripheral fibroma is a reactive hyperplastic mass that occurs on the gingiva and is believed to be derived from connective tissue of the submucosa or periodontal liga- ment (Figure 7-1). It may occur at any age, although it does have a predilection for young adults. Females develop these lesions more commonly than do males, and the gingiva anterior to the permanent molars is most often affected.
Peripheral fibroma may present clinically as a stalked (pedunculated) or a broad-based (sessile) mass that is simi- lar in color to surrounding connective tissue. Ulceration may be present over the summit of the lesion. It rarely causes erosion of subjacent alveolar bone.
• Figure 7-1 Peripheral fibroma of maxillary attached gingiva. (Re- produced with permission from Regezi JA, Sciubba JJ, Pogrel MA: Atlas of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology. Philadelphia, 2000, WB Saunders, Figure 4-31.)
Histopathology
Peripheral fibroma is a form of fibrous hyperplasia that may also be called hyperplastic scar. It is highly collagenous and relatively avascular, and it may contain a mild to moderate chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate. This lesion is basically the gingival counterpart to traumatic fibroma occurring in other mucosal regions.
Microscopically, several subtypes (below) of this lesion have been identified. These are essentially of academic inter- est because the biological behavior and treatment of these microscopic variants are the same.
Peripheral ossifying fibroma is a gingival mass in which islands of woven (immature) bone and osteoid are seen. The bone is found within a lobular proliferation of plump, be- nign fibroblasts. Chronic inflammatory cells tend to be seen around the periphery of the lesion (Figure 7-2). The surface is typically ulcerated.
Peripheral odontogenic fibroma is a gingival mass composed of well-vascularized, nonencapsulated fibrous connective tissue. The distinguishing feature of this vari- ant is the presence of strands of odontogenic epithelium, often abundant, throughout the connective tissue. Amor- phous hard tissue resembling tertiary (reactive) dentin, so-called dentinoid, may also be present. The lesion is usually nonulcerated.
Giant cell fibroma is a fibrous hyperplasia in which many of the mesenchymal cells are relatively larger than normal fibroblasts (giant cells) and assume a stellate shape. Immunohistochemical studies have shown that most of these stellate cells are fibroblasts (a few factor XIIIa–positive dendritic cells are also typically present) (Figure 7-3). These same peculiar stellate cells can be found in focal fibrous hyperplastic lesions throughout the oral mucosa and occa- sionally on the skin (fibrous papule). One form of this lesion is known as retrocuspid papilla of the mandible.
Differential Diagnosis
Clinically, these lesions usually are not confused with any- thing else. However, some overlap may be noted with pyogenic granuloma and, rarely, peripheral giant cell

  • Figure 7-3 Peripheral fibroma with stellate-shaped fibroblasts. granuloma, when these two lesions do not have a promi-
nent vascular component.
Treatment
Peripheral fibroma should be treated by local excision, which should include the periodontal ligament, if involved. Also, any identifiable etiologic agent, such as calculus or other foreign material, should be removed. Recurrence may occa- sionally be associated with the microscopic subtype: periph- eral ossifying fibroma. Reexcision to the periosteum or the periodontal ligament should prevent further recurrence.
Focal Fibrous Hyperplasia
Etiology
Focal fibrous hyperplasia is a reactive lesion usually caused by chronic trauma to oral mucous membranes. Overexuberant fibrous connective tissue repair results in a clinically evident submucosal mass. Although the terms traumatic fibroma and oral fibroma are often applied to these entities, they are mis- nomers because these lesions are not benign tumors of fibro- blasts, as the term fibroma implies (Box 7-1).
Clinical Features
No gender or racial predilection for the development of this intraoral lesion has been noted. It is a very common reactive hyperplasia that is typically found in frequently traumatized areas, such as the buccal mucosa, the lateral border of the tongue, and the lower lip (Figure 7-4). It is a painless, broad-based swelling that is paler in color than the surrounding tissue because of its relative lack of vascular

channels. The surface may occasionally be traumatically ulcerated, particularly in larger lesions. Lesions have limited growth potential and do not exceed 1 to 2 cm in diameter.
Multiple fibromas may be part of a rare autosomal- dominant syndrome known as Cowden’s syndrome or multi- ple hamartoma syndrome. Many organ systems, such as the mucosa, skin, breast, thyroid, and colon may be affected. Frequently encountered abnormalities include numerous oral fibromas and papillomas; cutaneous papules, keratoses, and trichilemmomas; benign and malignant neoplasms of the breast and thyroid; and colonic polyps. The underlying genetic problem appears to be related to germline mutations of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN found on chromosome 10q23.
Histopathology
Collagen overproduction is the basic process that dominates the microscopy of this lesion. Fibroblasts are mature and widely scattered in a dense collagen matrix. Sparse chronic inflammatory cells may be seen, usually in a perivascular distribution (Figure 7-5). Overlying epithelium is often hyperkeratotic because of chronic low-grade friction.
Differential Diagnosis
This is a relatively trivial lesion that should be removed to rule out other pathologic processes. Depending on its

location, several other entities might be included in a clinical differential diagnosis. Neurofibroma, schwan- noma, and granular cell tumor would be possibilities for masses in the tongue. In the lower lip and buccal mucosa, lipoma, mucocele, and salivary gland tumors might be considered. Although rare, benign neoplasms of mesen- chymal origin could present as submucosal masses not unlike focal fibrous hyperplasia.
Treatment
Simple surgical excision is usually effective. Infrequently, recurrence may be caused by continued trauma to the in- volved area. These lesions have no malignant potential.
Denture-Induced Fibrous Hyperplasia
Etiology
Denture-induced fibrous hyperplasia of oral mucosa is related to the chronic trauma produced by an ill-fitting denture. The process is essentially the same as the one that leads to traumatic fibroma, except that a denture is spe- cifically identified as the causative agent. This lesion has also been referred to by several older synonyms, including inflammatory hyperplasia, denture hyperplasia, and epulis fissuratum.
Clinical Features
Denture-induced fibrous hyperplasia is a common lesion that occurs in the vestibular mucosa and less commonly along the mandibular lingual sulcus where the denture flange contacts tissue (Figures 7-6 and 7-7). As the bony ridges of the mandible and the maxilla resorb with long- term denture use, the flanges gradually extend farther into the vestibule. There, chronic irritation and trauma may incite an exuberant fibrous connective tissue reparative response. The result is the appearance of painless folds of fibrous tissue surrounding the overextended denture flange.
Treatment
Some reduction in size of the lesion may follow prolonged removal of the denture. However, because the hyperplastic

• Figure 7-7 Denture-induced fibrous hyperplasia.
scar is relatively permanent, surgical excision is usually re- quired. Construction of a new denture or relining of the old one is also required to prevent recurrence.
Generalized Gingival Hyperplasia
Etiology
In generalized gingival hyperplasia, overgrowth of the gin- giva may vary from mild enlargement of the interdental pa- pillae to such severe uniform enlargement that the crowns of the teeth may be covered by hyperplastic tissue (Box 7-2). Uniform or generalized gingival fibrous connective tissue hyperplasia may be due to one of several etiologic factors. Most cases are nonspecific and are the result of an unusual hyperplastic tissue response to chronic inflammation associ- ated with local factors such as plaque, calculus, or bacteria. Why only some patients have a propensity for the develop- ment of connective tissue hyperplasia in response to local factors is unknown. Recent studies have reported a possible role for keratinocyte growth factor (a member of the fibro- blast growth factor family) in this condition.
Other conditions such as hormonal changes and drugs can significantly potentiate or exaggerate the effects of local factors on gingival connective tissue. Hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy and puberty have long been known to be associated with generalized gingival hyperpla- sia. This hyperresponsiveness during pregnancy has led to the infrequently used and inappropriate term pregnancy gingivitis. Altered hormonal conditions act in concert with local irritants to produce the hyperplastic response. It is questionable whether significant gingival enlargement during periods of hormonal imbalance would occur in individuals with scrupulous oral hygiene.
Phenytoin (Dilantin), a drug used in the control of seizure disorders, is a well-known etiologic factor in generalized gingival enlargement. It is thought that phe- nytoin causes impaired collagen degradation through suppression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)/tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and a2b1- integrin–mediated endocytosis. The extent or severity of so-called Dilantin hyperplasia is influenced by the pres- ence of local factors such as plaque and calculus. The

effects of time and dose of the drug on gingival tissue are not clear. Reported prevalence has ranged from 0% to 80%, depending on the investigator’s clinical criteria and the number of patients observed. A value of 50% is gen- erally accepted as the probable prevalence. In any event, the fact that not all patients taking phenytoin develop gingival hyperplasia indicates that some patients are pre- disposed to the development of this condition. It has only rarely been described in edentulous patients and in children before tooth eruption.
Cyclosporine, the immunosuppressant drug that is used to modulate T-lymphocyte function in transplant recipi- ents and in patients with various autoimmune diseases, has also been linked to gingival hyperplasia. The cause of this condition is not known, but edema secondary to increased sulfated-glycosaminoglycan synthesis by fibroblasts may play an important role. Not all patients are affected and local factors have a synergistic role. Unlike phenytoin- related hyperplasia, cyclosporine-induced hyperplasia has been reported to be a reversible process following cessation of drug use.
Nifedipine and other calcium channel blockers used in the treatment of cardiac angina, arrhythmias, and hyperten- sion are known to contribute to gingival hyperplasia. The process mimics phenytoin-related hyperplasia but, similar to cyclosporine-induced gingival hyperplasia, appears to be reversible.
Gingival enlargement is also known to occur in patients with leukemia, especially those with the chronic monocytic form. This is the result of infiltration of the gingival soft tissues by malignant white blood cells. It may be modulated by local factors such as plaque and calculus; because of the bleeding tendency associated with leukemic infiltrates within the bone marrow compartment resulting in second- ary reduction of platelet formation and maturation, leading to a reluctance of patients to practice adequate oral hygiene, resulting in the accumulation of plaque and debris. This accumulation may provide the inflammatory stimulus for connective tissue hyperplasia.
Some rare types of gingival hyperplasia that occur in early childhood have a hereditary basis. The best recognized is hereditary gingival fibromatosis, which clinically can re- semble Dilantin-induced gingival hyperplasia. Patients with other rare syndromes such as Zimmerman-Laband, Cross’, Rutherfurd’s, Murray-Puretic-Drescher (juvenile hyaline fibromatosis), and Cowden’s syndromes can demonstrate varying degrees of fibrous gingival hyperplasia.
Clinical Features
The clinical feature common to the variously caused gingival hyperplasias is an increase in bulk of the free and attached gingiva, especially the interdental papillae (Figures 7-8 to 7-10). Stippling is lost, and gingival margins become rolled and blunted. The consistency of the gingiva ranges from soft

and spongy to firm and dense, depending directly on the density and amount of fibrosis. A range of color from red- blue to lighter than surrounding tissue is also seen; this varies with the severity of the inflammatory response as well. Gen- erally, hyperplasias associated with nonspecific local factors and hormonal changes appear more inflamed clinically than drug-induced and idiopathic forms. The idiopathic type is particularly dense and fibrous, with relatively little inflam- matory change.
Histopathology
An abundance of collagen is noted. Fibroblasts are increased in number, and various degrees of chronic inflammation are seen. In some cases, especially those in which hormonal changes are important, capillaries may be increased and prominent. The overlying epithelium usually exhibits some hyperplasia. Occa- sionally, plasma cells dominate the histologic picture. In leuke- mic enlargements, atypical and immature white blood cells, representing a malignant infiltrate, may be found.
Treatment
In all forms of generalized gingival hyperplasia, attentive oral hygiene is necessary to minimize the effects of inflam- mation on fibrous proliferation and the effects of systemic factors. Gingivoplasty or gingivectomy may be required but should be done in combination with prophylaxis, oral hy- giene instruction, and a comprehensive home care program.
Neoplasms
Solitary Fibrous Tumor
Solitary fibrous tumor is a benign proliferation of spindle cells of disputed but probable fibroblastic origin (Box 7-3). This le- sion was first described as a tumor of the pleura and has subse- quently been described at many other sites. Oral lesions are seen in adults and present as submucosal masses predominantly in the buccal mucosa (Box 7-4). Rare cases cause hypoglycemia due to tumor production of insulin-like growth factors.
Microscopically, lesions are circumscribed and are composed of a “patternless” proliferation of spindle cells (Figure 7-11).
Some areas may suggest neurofibroma or Schwannoma, whereas others may suggest hemangiopericytoma or leiomy- oma. Tumor cells characteristically stain positive for STAT-6 (100%), CD34 (90%-95% of cases), CD99 (70%), and Bcl-2 (20%-35%) by immunohistochemistry. Many factor XIIIa–positive cells may be found. Immunohistochemistry has permitted a better understanding of this entity and more reliable identification; therefore, many oral tumors previously diagnosed by light microscopy as other soft tissue neoplasms such as leiomyoma, hemangiopericytoma, and benign fibrous histiocytoma probably represent solitary fibrous tumor. Giant cell angiofibroma, characterized by multinucleated floret-type giant cells, pseudovascular spaces and a recurrent NAB2-STAT6 gene fusion, is considered a variant of solitary fibrous tumor. Treatment consists of surgical excision. Al- though most cases are benign, the behavior of solitary fibrous tumors is unpredictable. Approximately 10% to 15% behave

aggressively, warranting long-term follow-up. A malignant variant is recognized but rare. It is important to note that correlation between histologic features and overall behavior is poor.
Myxoma
Clinical Features
Myxoma is a soft tissue neoplasm composed of gelatinous material resembling fetal umbilical cord and a myxoid mi- croscopic appearance. The oral form of soft tissue myxoma is a rare lesion that presents as a slow-growing, asymptom- atic submucosal mass, usually in the palate. No gender predilection has been noted, and the lesion may occur at any age. Oral soft tissue myxomas have been reported in an autosomal-dominantly inherited syndrome consisting of myxomas (including cardiac myxomas), mucocutaneous pigmentation, and endocrine abnormalities.
Histopathology
Oral myxomas are not encapsulated and may exhibit infiltration into surrounding soft tissue. Dispersed stellate and spindle- shaped fibroblasts are found in a loose myxoid stroma. Soft tissue myxomas may be confused with other myxoid lesions, such as nerve sheath myxoma and oral focal mucinosis (Table 7-1).
Nerve sheath myxoma arises from the endoneurium of a peripheral nerve. This lesion typically exhibits lobulated mucoid tissue containing stellate and spindle-shaped cells. Condensed connective tissue, representing perineurium, surrounds the lesion. With special stains, a fine reticulin network is seen throughout. Mast cells are characteristically present in this lesion and neural markers such as S-100 are expressed by the tumor.
Oral focal mucinosis represents the mucosal counterpart of cutaneous focal mucinosis. The lesion appears as a well- circumscribed area of myxomatous connective tissue in the submucosa. It contains no mast cells and no reticulin net- work, except that which surrounds supporting blood ves- sels. Unlike the nerve sheath myxoma, neural markers such as S-100 are negative.
Treatment
The treatment of choice for oral soft tissue myxoma, as well as other myxoid lesions, is surgical excision. Recurrence is not uncommon for myxomas but is unexpected for nerve sheath myxoma and focal mucinosis. All are benign pro- cesses and require conservative therapy only.
CHAPTER 7 Connective Tissue Lesions Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma
Clinical Features
Nasopharyngeal angiofibroma is also known as juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma because of its almost exclu- sive occurrence in the second decade of life. This tumor nearly always affects boys with up to 75% of tumors ex- pressing androgen but not estrogen or progesterone re- ceptors. This lesion characteristically produces a mass in the nasopharynx that arises along the posterolateral wall of the nasal roof and over time leads to obstruction or epistaxis that may, on occasion, be severe. Rarely, this lesion may present intraorally, causing palatal expansion or inferior displacement of the soft palate, which appears blue because of the intense vascularity of the lesion. It generally can be described as benign and slow-growing but unencapsulated and locally invasive. On occasion, it may exhibit aggressive clinical behavior, characterized by direct extension into the bones of the midface and the skull base. The symptom triad includes recurrent epistaxis, nasal obstruction, and mass effect within the nasopharynx.
Histopathology
Microscopically, nasopharyngeal angiofibroma has the ap- pearance of a mature, well-collagenized lesion containing cleft-like vascular channels. The evenly spaced fibroblasts have a uniform, benign appearance with plump nuclei. The vascular channels vary in size and are lined by endo- thelium that may occasionally be rimmed by smooth muscle cells.
Treatment
Although numerous forms of treatment, such as radiation, exogenous hormone administration, sclerosant therapy, and embolization, have been used for nasopharyngeal angiofi- broma, surgery remains the preferred form of therapy. Up to 40% of tumors recur, usually in the first year, because of incomplete excision, the invasive nature of the lesion, and the surgically difficult anatomic location.
Nodular Fasciitis
Clinical Features
Nodular fasciitis, also known as pseudosarcomatous fasciitis, is a well-recognized entity representing a myofi- broblastic proliferation. A closely related lesion known as proliferative myositis occurs in muscle. The cause of this

proliferation is unknown. Although some patients with nodular fasciitis report a history of trauma at the site of the lesion, most patients do not. Traditionally considered a re- active condition, it is now thought to be a clonal neoplasm. Although it is diploid, nodular fasciitis often carries a bal- anced translocation t(17;22) resulting in a MYH9-USP6 gene fusion. The condition typically presents as a firm mass in the dermis or the submucosa and exhibits such rapid growth clinically that malignancy may be suspected. Pain or tenderness often accompany the process. No gender predi- lection has been noted, and young adults and adults are usually affected. The trunk and the extremities are most commonly involved, with about 10% of cases reported to occur in the head and neck, usually in the skin of the face and the parotid sheath. Intraorally, the buccal mucosa is the most commonly affected site. All of these lesions are benign, and they often are managed by excision to remove the growing mass and to confirm the diagnosis. If left untreated, regression will occur.
Histopathology
A nodular growth contains plump spindle cells with vesicular nuclei in a haphazard to storiform arrangement (Figure 7-12). Myxoid areas are usually found. Multinucleated giant cells are
occasionally present and may originate from adjacent muscle or from fusion of macrophages. Mitotic figures may be frequent but are morphologically normal in appearance. Inflammatory cells and extravasated red blood cells are also microscopic features of nodular fasciitis. By immunohisto- chemistry, the cells in nodular fasciitis express smooth muscle and muscle-specific actins in a “tram-track” pattern consistent with a myofibroblastic phenotype.
Proliferative myositis, an analogous lesion that occurs within muscle, is a reactive lesion that occurs usually in the trunk and rarely in the head and neck (sternomastoid muscle). It parallels the clinical course of nodular fasciitis, although it first appears in an older age group.
Differential Diagnosis
Diagnostic problems relative to nodular fasciitis occur because many of its microscopic features are shared by other fibrous proliferations, such as fibromatosis, benign fibrous histiocytoma, and fibrosarcoma (Table 7-2). Fibro- matosis is more infiltrative than nodular fasciitis and may exhibit a fascicular growth pattern. It also produces more collagen, is generally less cellular, and has fewer mitotic figures. In addition, nuclear beta-catenin expression is seen in fibromatosis but not in nodular fasciitis. A benign

fibrous histiocytoma is rare in the mouth and is histologi- cally more cellular with a storiform pattern; it may not be as well circumscribed as nodular fasciitis. Fibrosarcoma is infiltrative and exhibits a herringbone pattern. Nuclei are pleomorphic and hyperchromatic, and mitoses are more abundant and atypical. By immunohistochemistry, the cells of nodular fasciitis express smooth muscle actin but not desmin.
Treatment
Conservative surgical excision is the treatment of choice for nodular fasciitis. Local recurrence occurs in only 2% of cases, and in these instances, the diagnosis should be reevaluated.
Myofibroblastic Tumors
Clinical Features
Myofibromatosis and myofibromas represent benign prolif- erations of myofibroblasts. Myofibromatosis is multifocal and occurs in infants; myofibroma is solitary and occurs over a wide age range. These lesions can appear at a variety of sites in the body but have a predilection for the head and neck, in particular, the oral cavity. They can occur in soft tissues or in bone and present as slow-growing, circum- scribed masses.
Histopathology
Tumors show pushing, well-demarcated borders. Paucicellular lobules with hyalinized or collagenous stroma alternate with cellular zones, giving a hemangiopericytoma-like appearance. Tumor cells are generally uniform, showing tapered nuclei, and express smooth muscle actin. They are negative for desmin, CD34, and S-100 but positive for smooth muscle antigens, including actin and calponin (Figure 7-13). Lack of expression of desmin helps differentiate this tumor from leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma, which are rare in the oral cavity.
Treatment
Myofibromas are benign, and local excision is generally curative. Some myofibromas can even show spontaneous regression. Local recurrences occur in about 10% of cases.
CHAPTER 7 Connective Tissue Lesions Fibromatosis
Fibromatosis comprises a group of locally aggressive neo- plasms that show infiltrative, destructive, and recurrent growth but no tendency to metastasize. They are classified as superficial (palmar, plantar) or deep (desmoid). Superficial fibromatoses do not occur in the oral cavity. Deep fibroma- toses are clinically diverse, deep-seated, fibrous proliferations. Three types have been identified: sporadic, familial adenoma- tous polyposis (FAP) associated, and multicentric (familial). They can be further classified anatomically as extraabdominal (60% of cases), abdominal wall (25% of cases), or intraab- dominal (15% of cases). Only extraabdominal desmoid fi- bromatoses occur in the head and neck. Fibromatoses are clonal neoplasms with abnormalities of the Wnt/b-catenin pathway including somatic point mutations of exon 3 codon 41 or 45 in 87% of cases. Trisomy 20 and loss of 5q (APC gene) have also been reported.
Clinical Features
All extraabdominal desmoids are locally infiltrative lesions that have significant recurrence potential. Lesions typically present as firm asymptomatic masses. They are typically seen in children and young adults, with females affected twice as often as males. The most common site is the shoul- der area and trunk, with about 10% of cases appearing in the soft tissues of the head and neck. The mandible and contiguous soft tissues are most often involved intraorally. Lesions are slower growing than those of nodular fasciitis and are less likely to be symptomatic.
Histopathology
Fibromatosis is an unencapsulated infiltrative lesion with a fascicular growth pattern (Figure 7-14). The lesion is com- posed of highly differentiated connective tissue containing uniform, compact fibroblasts, often surrounded by abundant collagen. Nuclei are not atypical, and mitotic figures are in- frequent. When muscle invasion occurs, giant cells represent- ing degenerate muscle cells may be seen. Slitlike vascular spaces are usually seen as well. Overall, the bland microscopic appearance of this lesion belies its locally aggressive behavior.

Connective Tissue Lesions
  • Figure 7-14 Fibromatosis appearing as deceptively bland fibro- blastic proliferation. Note residual skeletal muscle (right) surrounded by invasive tumor.
By immunohistochemistry, cells are CD34, desmin, and S-100 negative, but show variable expression of smooth muscle, muscle-specific actins, and CD117. Expression of beta-catenin in the nuclei of tumor cells may be helpful in establishing the diagnosis of fibromatosis, but although this assay is sensitive, it is not specific. In contrast to fibrosar- coma, fibromatoses lack alterations of Bcl-2, RB1, and p53.
Treatment
Recurrence rates in the range of 20% to 60% have been reported for fibromatosis. Because of this, and because of the locally destructive nature of fibromatosis, an aggressive surgical approach is recommended. No metastatic potential has been reported, although some cases, particularly in the head and neck, have proved fatal.
Fibrosarcoma
At one time, fibrosarcoma was the most common soft tissue sarcoma. With the introduction of electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry, it became evident that many previ- ously diagnosed fibrosarcomas represented a range of spin- dle cell malignancies. Today, fibrosarcoma is defined as a rare malignant spindle cell tumor showing a herringbone or interlacing fascicular pattern and no expression of other connective tissue cell markers. The cause of fibrosarcoma is not known. No specific predisposing factors are known, although some lesions arise in previously irradiated sites, and others are noted in preexisting connective tissue tumors such as solitary fibrous tumor, well-differentiated liposarcoma, and dermatofibrosarcoma. Although multiple chromosome abnormalities have been reported in fibrosarcoma, evidence suggests that alterations in one or more genes in the 2q14-22 region might contribute to the pathogenesis of this tumor.
Clinical Features
Fibrosarcoma is a rare soft tissue and bony malignancy of the head and neck (Figure 7-15). A tumor results from proliferation of malignant mesenchymal cells at the site of origin. Secondary ulceration may be seen as the lesion
• Figure 7-15 Fibrosarcoma of the buccal mucosa.
enlarges. Young adults are most commonly affected. This is an infiltrative neoplasm that is more of a locally destructive problem than a metastatic problem.
Histopathology
Microscopically, fibrosarcoma exhibits malignant-appearing fibroblasts, typically in a herringbone or interlacing fascicu- lar pattern (Figure 7-16). Collagen may be sparse, and mi- totic figures frequent. The degree of cell differentiation from one tumor to another may be quite variable. The pe- riphery of this lesion is ill defined because the neoplasm freely invades surrounding tissue. Fibrosarcoma is essen- tially a diagnosis of exclusion, and by definition, there should be no expression of actin, S-100, epithelial mem- brane antigen, keratin, CD34, or myogenin.
Treatment
Wide surgical excision is generally advocated for fibrosar- coma because of the difficulty involved in controlling local growth. Although recurrence is not uncommon, metastasis is infrequent. Fibrosarcomas of bone are more likely to me- tastasize via the bloodstream than are soft tissue lesions. The overall 5-year survival rate ranges between 30% and 50%.
• Figure 7-16 Fibrosarcoma composed of atypical spindle cells.

Generally, patients with soft tissue lesions fare better than those with primary lesions of bone. Also, well-differentiated lesions have a better prognosis than do those with poorly differentiated features.
Synovial Sarcoma
Synovial sarcoma (SS) accounts for about 10% or more of all soft tissue sarcomas. The peak incidence is seen in the third decade, with about one third of cases occurring in patients younger than 20 years. Despite its name, synovial sarcoma does not arise from synovial tissue, and the cause is generally not known. SS is a morphologically and genetically distinct sarcoma characterized by the specific chromosomal translocation t(X;18) (p11;q11). This trans- location event produces an SYT-SSX fusion gene, which is the result of joining of the SYT gene on chromosome 18 with one of three SSX genes (SSX1, SSX2, and SSX4) on the X chromosome. Different forms are recognized histologically, depending on the presence and proportion of spindle and epithelial cells. When both patterns are present, the tumor is termed biphasic, but when only one is present, the tumor is termed monophasic. Clinically, SS presents as an expanding mass, and symptoms are related to this tumor mass effect on normal structures. Symptoms may be present for a long time before the diagnosis is made because the tumor generally grows slowly. The opti- mal treatment for SS has not been established, but current therapy is similar to that of several other sarcomas, com- bining surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Five-year survival rates depend on the stage of the tumor at presen- tation and on whether the tumor can be completely excised. For localized disease, 5-year survival rates may approach 80%, but for more extensive tumors, survival is significantly reduced.
Fibrohistiocytic Tumors
The original concept that some tumors show fibrohistio- cytic differentiation was based on the notion that there exists a dual population of fibroblasts and histiocytes (mac- rophages) that in tissue culture show ameboid growth and phagocytic properties. It is now accepted that this concept is incorrect and that the tumors in this category show no his- tiocyte (macrophage) differentiation. Immunohistochemical evidence now favors a fibroblast cell of origin. However, the term fibrous histiocytoma has persisted to describe a group of likely unrelated benign and malignant tumors that share many histologic similarities.
Benign Fibrous Histiocytoma
Clinical Features
Benign fibrous histiocytomas are fibroblastic neoplasms that rarely occur in oral soft tissues, skin, or bone. These are adult lesions, typically noted in the fifth decade and present as painless masses that may be ulcerated. Intrabony lesions present as radiolucencies, often with ill-defined margins.
• Figure 7-17 Benign fibrous histiocytoma composed of plump fibroblasts.
Histopathology
This tumor is fairly well demarcated and often is circum- scribed at the periphery. A storiform (cartwheel or matlike) growth pattern of spindle cells (fibroblasts) is noted, with plump or vesicular nuclei admixed with some inflammatory cells (Figure 7-17). Tumor giant cells may be seen. No cellular atypia is present, and mitotic figures are infrequent and normal in appearance. Immunohisto- chemical stains are of little diagnostic value. Fibrous his- tiocytomas may show some positive staining for smooth muscle actin and/or CD34, but a consistent pattern has not been demonstrated.
Treatment
Surgical excision is the treatment of choice for benign fibrous histiocytoma. Lesions usually do not recur.
Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma (Pleomorphic Undifferentiated Sarcoma)
Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) is a controversial soft tissue malignancy whose pathogenesis continues to be rede- fined. MFH was originally defined on the basis of morpho- logic and tissue culture analysis as a pleomorphic sarcoma that showed both fibroblastic and histiocytic differentiation. This concept is no longer accepted. MFH, at one time, was the most frequently used term for soft tissue sarcoma of late adult life. Five variants showing differing clinical and histologic fea- tures were described: prototypical pleomorphic-storiform, myxoid, giant cell, inflammatory, and angiomatoid. It has been proposed that the term MFH should be reserved for a small group of undifferentiated sarcomas lacking differentiation markers of other sarcomas; thus it is a diagnosis of exclusion. An interchangeable synonym is pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma. The angiomatoid type shows distinct clinical and histologic features and probably represents an entity that is distinct from other tumors in this category.
Clinical Features
MFH is an infrequently reported lesion in the head and neck. It may occur in bone, where it follows a more

172 CHAPTER 7
Connective Tissue Lesions
aggressive course than in soft tissue. Biologically, it has significant recurrence and metastatic potential that is dependent, in part, on clinical factors such as anatomic site, depth of location, and size.
Overall, MFH occurs in late adult life and is rare in children. Men are affected more often than women. The extremities and the retroperitoneum are favored sites. Intra- oral soft tissue lesions appear to have no site predilection. Although only a small number have been reported, almost all regions have been affected. MFH has also been reported in the mandible and the maxilla, resulting in radiolucencies with poorly defined margins.
Histopathology
Basic to all MFH is the proliferation of pleomorphic spindle cells. Abnormal and frequent mitotic figures, necro- sis, and extensive cellular atypia may be seen. In some le- sions, a storiform pattern may dominate the microscopic picture; in others, myxoid zones, giant cells, acute inflam- matory cells, xanthoma cells, or blood vessels may be prominent. Immunohistochemistry is helpful in excluding pleomorphic variants of other sarcomas such as leiomyosar- coma, liposarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and myxofibrosar- coma. It is now accepted that histiocytic markers play no role in the diagnosis of pleomorphic sarcoma. These mark- ers include alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, CD68, and lysozyme.
Treatment
Wide surgical excision is the usual treatment. Radiation or chemotherapy offers limited additional benefit. The 5-year survival rate ranges from 20% to 60%. Patients with oral lesions generally fare somewhat worse than others. Recur- rence and metastatic rates are about 40%.
Vascular Lesions
Reactive Lesions and Congenital Lesions
Lymphangioma
Etiology
Regarded as a congenital lesion, lymphangioma usually appears within the first two decades of life. Involution over time, in contrast to the situation with congenital hemangio- mas, does not usually occur.
Clinical Features
Lymphangiomas present as painless, nodular, vesicle-like swellings when superficial, or as submucosal masses when located deeper. The color ranges from lighter than sur- rounding tissue to red-blue when capillaries are part of the congenital malformation (Figures 7-18 and 7-19). On palpation, the lesions may produce a crepitant sound as lymphatic fluid is pushed from one area to another.
The tongue is the most common intraoral site, and the lesions may be responsible for macroglossia when dif- fusely distributed throughout the submucosa (Box 7-5).

• Figure 7-19 Combined lymphangioma and hemangioma of the tongue.

Lymphangioma of the lip may cause a macrocheilia. Lymph- angioma of the neck, known as cystic hygroma, hygroma colli, or cavernous lymphangioma, is a diffuse soft tissue swelling that may be life threatening because it involves vital structures of the neck. Respiratory distress, intrale- sional hemorrhage, and disfigurement are all potential sequelae to cystic hygroma.
Histopathology
Endothelium-lined lymphatic channels are diffusely dis- tributed in the submucosa (Figure 7-20). The cells lining these spaces characteristically are positive for lymphatic markers such as using the D2-40 antibody. The channels

contain eosinophilic lymph that occasionally includes red blood cells, especially in mixed lymphatic and capil- lary proliferations. There is no capsule. A characteristic feature is the location of lymphatic channels directly adjacent to overlying epithelium, with no apparent inter- vening connective tissue.
Treatment
Lymphangiomas usually are surgically removed, but be- cause of their lack of encapsulation, recurrences are com- mon. Sclerotherapy has also been used successfully; in this procedure, sclerosing solutions are injected into cystic areas, with subsequent scarring of the aberrant vascular channels and generally acceptable results. Large lymphangiomas, such as cystic hygromas, may require staged surgical proce- dures to gain control of the lesion.
Neoplasms
Hemangiopericytoma
Hemangiopericytoma is a rare neoplasm that was originally described as a vascular tumor derived from the pericyte. This cell is believed to be a modified smooth muscle cell that is normally found surrounding capillaries and venules, between the basement membrane and the endothelium. The cell probably has a contractile property and serves as an endothe- lial reserve cell. Immunohistochemical evidence indicates that conceptually this tumor is not derived from the pericyte because it does not express actin or myofibroblastic markers. It is likely that the neoplastic cell is an undifferentiated or fibroblastic cell. It has been suggested that many tumors pre- viously diagnosed microscopically as hemangiopericytomas represent other soft tissue tumors that share similar features. For example, considerable histologic overlap has been noted between myofibroma, solitary fibrous tumor, synovial sar- coma, and mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, and it is conceiv- able that many hemangiopericytomas represent one of these entities. Increasingly, the diagnosis of hemangiopericytoma is a diagnosis of exclusion.
This neoplasm appears as a mass that may occur in any location of the body across a wide age spectrum. No
distinguishing clinical signs would suggest a diagnosis of hemangiopericytoma.
Microscopically, the neoplasm is characterized by a prolifera- tion of well-differentiated, oval to spindle-shaped mesenchymal cells separated by small, slitlike vascular channels. The vessels are thin walled and may exhibit “staghorn” profiles, although this pattern is also seen in several other soft tissue tumors.
The biological behavior of hemangiopericytoma is unpre- dictable. At least 70% of cases have a benign course, while 30% are diagnosed as malignant. Unfortunately, no reliable histologic criteria can be used to predict the clinical course, although necrosis, numerous mitotic figures, a high prolifera- tion marker (Ki67 or proliferating cell nuclear antigen [PCNA]), a labeling index, and hypercellularity may suggest a more aggressive lesion. The treatment of choice is wide surgi- cal excision. Recurrence and metastases are not uncommon.
Angiosarcoma
Angiosarcoma is a rare neoplasm of endothelial cell origin and unknown cause. Kaposi’s sarcoma, also of endothelial origin, but known to be caused by the human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8), is distinct from angiosarcoma.
The scalp is the usual location for angiosarcomas, although occasional lesions have been reported in the maxillary sinus and oral cavity. The lesion consists of an unencapsulated proliferation of anaplastic endothelial cells enclosing irregular luminal spaces. It has an aggressive clinical course and a poor prognosis.
Neural Lesions
Reactive Lesions
Traumatic Neuroma
Etiology
Traumatic neuromas are caused by injury to a peripheral nerve. In the oral cavity, the injury may occur with trauma from a surgical procedure such as a tooth extraction, from a local anes- thetic injection, or from an accident. Transection of a sensory nerve can result in inflammation and scarring in the area of injury. As the proximal nerve segment proliferates in an attempt to regenerate into the distal segment, it becomes entangled and trapped in the developing scar, resulting in a disorganized com- posite mass of fibrous tissue, Schwann cells, and axons.
Clinical Features
About half of patients with oral traumatic neuromas have associated pain. Pain ranges from occasional tenderness to constant, severe pain. Radiating facial pain occasionally may be caused by a traumatic neuroma (Figure 7-21). Injection of local anesthesia into the area of tumescence relieves the pain.
Lesions occur over a wide age range, although most are seen in adults. The mental foramen is the most common location, followed by extraction sites in the anterior maxilla and the posterior mandible. The lower lip, tongue, buccal mucosa, and palate are also relatively common soft tissue locations.

• Figure 7-22 Traumatic neuroma composed of fibrous tissue and nerve bundles.
Histopathology
Microscopically, bundles of nerves in a haphazard or tortu- ous arrangement are found admixed with dense collagenous fibrous tissue (Figure 7-22). A chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate may be seen in a minority of cases, particularly those that are symptomatic.
Treatment
Even though surgical transection of a peripheral nerve may have caused the lesion, surgical excision is the treatment of choice. Recurrence is infrequent.
Neoplasms
Granular Cell Tumors
Etiology
Granular cell tumor, formerly known as granular cell myo- blastoma, is an uncommon benign tumor of unknown cause. The unique granular cells that make up the lesion are believed to be of neural (Schwann cell) origin, predomi- nantly on the basis of immunohistochemical studies. Ori- gins from skeletal muscle, macrophages, undifferentiated mesenchymal cells, and pericytes have been suggested but are unproven.
A related lesion known as congenital gingival granular cell tumor (congenital epulis) is composed of cells that are light microscope identical to those of granular cell tumors. Slight differences have been noted by ultrastructural and immunohistochemical analysis, suggesting that congenital gingival tumors have a different histogenesis from granular cell tumors.
Clinical Features
Granular cell tumors appear in a range of patients from children to the elderly, with the mean appearance usually in middle adult life. Some studies have shown a predilec- tion for females; others have shown nearly equal gender distribution (Box 7-6). In the head and neck, the tongue is by far the most common location for granular cell tu- mors (Figure 7-23). However, any oral location may be affected.
Presentation typically occurs as an uninflamed asymp- tomatic mass smaller than 2 cm in diameter. The tumor often has a yellowish surface coloration. The overlying epi- thelium is intact. Multiple lesions occasionally have been described.

Oral Granular Cell Tumor
    
www.konkur.in
Congenital gingival granular cell tumors appear on the gingiva (usually anterior) of newborns (Box 7-7). These le- sions present as uninflamed, pedunculated, or broad-based masses (Figure 7-24). The maxillary gingiva is more often involved than the mandibular gingiva, and girls are affected more often than boys. The lesion does not recur, and spon- taneous regression has been reported.
Histopathology
The clinical tumescence of granular cell tumors is due to the presence of unencapsulated sheets of large polygonal cells with pale granular or grainy cytoplasm (Figures 7-25 to 7-27). The nuclei are small, compact, and morphologically benign. Mitotic figures are rare. Pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia of the overlying oral epithelium is seen in about half of cases. This may be such a prominent feature that subjacent granular cells are overlooked, resulting in overdiagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. The pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia over- lying granular cell tumor is a completely benign process.
Ultrastructurally, granular cells of both the granular cell tumor and its congenital gingival counterpart contain autophagic vacuoles. One of the consistent differences noted has been the absence of angulate bodies in the gin- gival lesion. Also, in some gingival lesions, the presence of microfilaments with fusiform dense bodies, pinocytotic vesicles, and basement membrane has been noted.

Immunohistochemically, granular cell tumors express S-100 protein typical of neural tumors, CD57, and type IV collagen. Both lesions express carcinoembryonic anti- gens and human leukocyte antigens (HLA-DR) but are negative for alpha-1-antichymotrypsin and muscle actin. The congenital granular cell tumor is typically positive for NKI-C3 like other non-neural granular cell lesions.

Connective Tissue Lesions
Differential Diagnosis
Clinically, granular cell tumors might be confused with other connective tissue lesions. Neurofibroma, schwannoma, and palisaded encapsulated neuroma would be prime con- siderations for tongue lesions. Salivary gland tumors, li- poma, and other benign mesenchymal neoplasms may present intraorally as asymptomatic lumps similar to granu- lar cell tumor. Focal fibrous hyperplasia (traumatic fibroma) is a common reactive lesion that should be included in a differential diagnosis. A biopsy with histopathologic analy- sis is the only way to achieve a definitive diagnosis.
Congenital gingival granular cell tumor is clinically distinct because of the age of the patient and the location in which the mass is seen. Other submucosal masses that occur in the gingiva of infants, such as gingival cyst and neuroectodermal tumor of infancy, are more deeply seated and broad based. Rhabdomyosarcoma tends to grow more rapidly and is darker in color.
Treatment
Granular cell tumors are surgically excised in a conservative fashion and generally do not recur.
Schwannoma
Etiology
Schwannoma, or neurilemmoma, is a benign neoplasm that is derived from a proliferation of Schwann cells of the neu- rilemma, or nerve sheath. As the lesion grows, the nerve is pushed aside and does not become enmeshed within the tumor.
Clinical Features
This lesion is an encapsulated submucosal mass that pre- sents typically as an asymptomatic lump in patients of any age (Table 7-3). The tongue is the favored location, al- though lesions have been described throughout the mouth. Bony lesions produce a well-defined radiolucent pattern
Neural Tumors: Comparative Features
with a corticated periphery and may cause pain or paresthe- sia. The lesion usually develops slowly, but it may undergo a sudden increase in size, which is thought in some cases to be due to intralesional hemorrhage. The fact that solitary schwannomas usually are not seen in neurofibromatosis is of clinical significance.
Histopathology
In this encapsulated tumor, spindle cells assume two different patterns. In one pattern, so-called Antoni A areas consist of spindle cells organized in palisaded whorls and waves. These cells often surround an acellular eosinophilic zone (Verocay body) representing reduplicated basement membrane and cytoplasmic cellular processes (Figure 7-28). The other pattern is the so-called Antoni B tissue, consisting of spindle cells haphazardly distributed in a delicate fibrillar microcystic ma- trix. By immunohistochemistry, this tumor strongly expresses S-100 protein. Stains for actin and desmin are negative.
A microscopic variant known as ancient schwannoma has been described to designate degenerative changes in a long-standing schwannoma. In this variant, fibrosis, inflam- matory cells, and hemorrhage may be seen.
Treatment
Schwannomas are surgically excised, and recurrence is unlikely. The prognosis is excellent.
Neurofibroma
Etiology
Neurofibromas may appear as solitary lesions or as multiple lesions as part of the syndrome neurofibromatosis (von Recklinghausen’s disease of skin). The cause of solitary neuro- fibroma is unknown. Neurofibromatosis, on the other hand, is inherited as an autosomal-dominant trait. It has variable expressivity and often (50% of cases) appears after spontane- ous mutation. Two subsets have been defined: one associated with the NF1 gene and the other with the NF2 gene.

Clinical Features
Solitary neurofibroma presents at any age as an uninflamed asymptomatic, submucosal mass. The tongue, buccal mucosa, and vestibule are the oral regions most commonly affected (Figures 7-29 and 7-30).
Oral lesions are typically associated with neurofibroma- tosis type 1 (NF-1). This condition includes multiple neu- rofibromas (Figures 7-31 and 7-32), cutaneous café-au-lait macules (Figure 7-33), bone abnormalities, central nervous

system changes, and other stigmata. Neurofibromas range clinically from discrete, superficial nodules to deep, diffuse masses. Lesions may be so numerous and prominent that they become cosmetically significant. Intraoral neurofibromas may be seen in as many as 25% of patients with neurofibromatosis. When other oral stigmata such as enlarged fungiform papillae and bone abnormalities are included, oral manifestations may be seen in as many as 70% of neurofibromatosis patients. Malignant transformation of neurofibroma into a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (neurogenic sarcoma) can occur in 5% to 15% of patients with this syndrome.
The presence of six or more café-au-lait macules at any location greater than 1.5 cm in diameter is generally regarded as being suggestive of neurofibromatosis. Other important diagnostic signs of the syndrome are axillary freckling (Crowe’s sign) and iris freckling (Lisch spots).
Bone changes may be seen in half or more of patients with neurofibromatosis. The changes may occur in the form of cortical erosion from adjacent soft tissue tumors or medullary resorption from intraosseous lesions. In the mandible, lesions most commonly arise from the man- dibular nerve and may result in pain or paresthesia. In such cases of mandibular involvement, an accompanying radiographic sign may be the formation of a flaring of the inferior alveolar foramen, the so-called blunderbuss foramen.
Histopathology
Solitary and multiple neurofibromas have the same micro- scopic features (Figure 7-34). They contain spindle-shaped cells, with fusiform or wavy nuclei found in a delicate con- nective tissue matrix; this matrix may be notably myxoid in character. Lesions may be well circumscribed or may blend into surrounding connective tissue. Mast cells are character- istically scattered throughout the lesion. A histologic subtype known as plexiform neurofibroma is regarded as highly char- acteristic of neurofibromatosis. In this variety, a collagen matrix supports extensive interlacing masses of nerve tissue. Small axons may be seen among the proliferating Schwann cells and perineural cells.
Demonstration of S-100 protein and neurofilaments by immunohistochemistry may be useful in confirming the di- agnosis of neurofibroma, although cautious interpretation of S-100 staining is required. S-100 protein, once thought to be unique to the central nervous system, has been identified in numerous other cells outside the central nervous system, in- cluding Schwann cells, chondrocytes, Langerhans cells, and some nevus cells. Antibody to S-100 protein stains a wide array of unrelated neoplasms, including neural tumors, para- ganglioma, some salivary gland tumors, granular cell tumor, Langerhans cell disease (LCD), chondrosarcoma, some muscle tumors, and approximately 95% of melanomas.
Differential Diagnosis
A solitary nodular neurofibroma should be considered in a clinical differential diagnosis with other submucosal masses of connective tissue origin, such as traumatic fibroma,
• Figure 7-34 Neurofibroma. A and B, Haphazardly arranged spindle (Schwann) cells.
granular cell tumor, and lipoma. A diffuse neurofibroma resulting in macroglossia may require differentiation from lymphangioma and possibly amyloidosis.
Treatment
Solitary neurofibromas are treated by surgical excision and have little chance of recurrence. Multiple lesions of neuro- fibromatosis may be treated in the same way but may be so numerous that excision becomes impractical. The prognosis for a patient who has had neurosarcomatous change in a preexisting lesion is poor.
Mucosal Neuroma of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Syndrome Type III
Etiology
The multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes com- prise a group of conditions characterized by neoplasms aris- ing in several endocrine organs. Only MEN type III (also known as MEN 2b), inherited as an autosomal-dominant trait, has oral manifestations (Table 7-4). MEN III is caused by a mutation in the RET oncogene resulting in a single amino acid substitution of a single methionine to threonine that affects a critical region of the tyrosine kinase catalytic core. Although a mutation of the RET gene is also responsi- ble for the MEN II (also known as MEN 2a) syndrome, the mutations are different.

Soft Tissue Tumors: Cytogenetic Abnormalities
   Clinical Features
MEN III consists of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, pheochromocytoma of the adrenal, and mucosal neuromas (Figure 7-35). Café-au-lait macules and neurofibromas of the skin may also be seen in this condition. MEN I and MEN II are related to MEN III in that patients with types I and II syndromes have neoplasms of various endocrine organs, but they do not have the oral manifestations of mucosal neuromas.
The mucosal neuromas of MEN III usually appear early in life as small, discrete nodules on the conjunctiva, labia, or larynx, or in the oral cavity. The oral lesions are seen on the tongue, lips, and buccal mucosa.
Histopathology
Mucosal neuromas are composed of serpiginous bands of nerve tissue surrounded by normal connective tissue (Figure 7-36). Axons have been found in the proliferating nerve tissue.
• Figure 7-35 Mucosal neuromas of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) III.
• Figure 7-36 Mucosal neuroma of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) III.
Treatment
Mucosal neuromas are surgically excised and are not ex- pected to recur. The neuromas themselves are relatively trivial, but they are of considerable significance because they may be the first sign of this potentially fatal syndrome. The medullary carcinoma of the thyroid is a progressive malignancy that invades locally and has the ability to me- tastasize to local lymph nodes and distant organs. The 5-year survival rate of this malignancy is about 50%. Pheochromocytoma is a benign neoplasm that produces catecholamines that may cause significant hypertension and other cardiovascular abnormalities. Early detection of mucosal neuromas therefore is of utmost importance in establishing the diagnosis or calling attention to other com- ponents of the syndrome.
Palisaded Encapsulated Neuroma (Solitary Circumscribed Neuroma)
Palisaded encapsulated neuroma is another oral tumor of neural origin. It is not associated with neurofibromatosis or MEN III. It occurs typically in the palate and occasionally on the lips at the mucocutaneous junction. This dome- shaped nodule is encapsulated and exhibits a fascicular mi- croscopic pattern with some suggestion of nuclear palisading (Figure 7-37). The tumor is composed of cells positive for

Connective Tissue Lesions
S-100 protein (Schwann cells) and some axons. After surgi- cal removal, recurrence is unexpected.
Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a rare malignancy that may develop from a preexisting neuro- fibroma or de novo. It can complicate neurofibromatosis. The cell of origin is believed to be the Schwann cell and possibly other nerve sheath cells.
In soft tissues, MPNST appears as an expansile mass that is usually asymptomatic. In bone, where it is believed to arise most often from the inferior alveolar nerve, it presents as a dilation of the mandibular canal or as a diffuse radiolu- cency. Pain or paresthesia may accompany the lesion in bone; this is also the case for other malignancies within the mandible or the maxilla.
Microscopically, MPNST can be seen arising from a neurofibroma or from a nerve trunk. The lesion is com- posed of abundant spindle cells with variable numbers of abnormal mitotic figures. Streaming and palisading of nu- clei are often seen, and nuclear pleomorphism may be prominent. Microscopic separation of this lesion from fi- brosarcoma and leiomyosarcoma may be difficult, making immunohistochemistry an important diagnostic adjunct. Positive staining of tumor cells, at least focally, for S-100 protein and neurofilaments would be helpful in this regard.
The primary method of treatment is wide surgical exci- sion. However, recurrence is common, and metastases are frequently seen. The prognosis varies from fair to good, depending on clinical circumstances.
Olfactory Neuroblastoma
Olfactory neuroblastoma, also known as esthesioneuroblas- toma, is a rare malignant lesion that arises from olfactory tissue in the superior portion of the nasal cavity. This lesion, which typically occurs in young adults, may result in epistaxis, rhinorrhea, or nasal obstruction, or it may present as polyps in the roof of the nasal cavity. It could result in a nasopharyngeal mass or an invasive maxillary sinus lesion.
Microscopically, this lesion consists of small, undifferenti- ated, round cells with little visible cytoplasm (Figure 7-38).
• Figure 7-38 Olfactory neuroblastoma; “a round cell tumor.”
Compartmentalization and pseudorosette and rosette forma- tions are often seen. Positive immunohistochemistry staining for chromogranin, synaptophysin, and neurofilaments can be used to confirm the light microscopic diagnosis. A microscopic differential diagnosis would include lymphoma, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing’s sarcoma, and undifferentiated carcinoma.
Surgery or radiation is used to treat olfactory neuroblas- toma. Recurrences are not uncommon, occurring in about half of patients. Metastasis, usually to local nodes or lung, occurs infrequently.
Muscle Lesions
Reactive Lesions
Myositis Ossificans
Myositis ossificans is an uncommon reactive lesion of skel- etal muscle. It may appear in the muscles of the head and neck. As the name implies, the condition is an intramuscu- lar inflammatory process in which ossification occurs. The reason for the appearance of bone within the muscle during the reparative process has not been fully explained.
Muscle ossification may be seen in either of two forms: as a progressive systemic disease (myositis ossificans progres- siva) of unknown cause, or as a focal single-muscle disorder (traumatic myositis ossificans). In the latter form, acute or chronic trauma may be responsible for the muscular change. The masseter and the sternocleidomastoid muscles are most commonly affected within the head and neck region. As the lesion matures, soft tissue radiographs show a delicate feath- ery opacification. Proliferating osteoblasts have occasionally been confused microscopically with malignant cells of os- teosarcoma. Maturation and organization of the osseous tissue peripheral to the central cellular zone are believed to be important diagnostic features of myositis ossificans. The lesion is treated with surgical excision and has little tendency to recur.
Neoplasms
Leiomyoma and Leiomyosarcoma
Smooth muscle neoplasms, in general, are relatively com- mon and may arise anywhere in the body (Table 7-5). Leiomyomas most commonly arise in the muscularis layer of the gut and in the body of the uterus (Figure 7-39). Leiomyosarcomas most commonly arise in the retroperito- neum, mesentery, omentum, or subcutaneous and in deep tissues of the limbs (Figure 7-40).
Both leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma are rare in the oral cavity. Oral leiomyomas present as slow-growing, asymp- tomatic submucosal masses, usually in the tongue, hard palate, or buccal mucosa. They may be seen at any age and usually are discovered when they are 1 to 2 cm in diameter.
Microscopic diagnosis may occasionally be difficult be- cause the spindle cell proliferation shares many similarities with neurofibroma, schwannoma, fibromatosis, and myofi-

Oral Spindle Cell Neoplasms: Differential Immunoprofile
   broma. Special stains that identify collagen may be helpful in distinguishing these lesions. Immunohistochemical demonstration of actins can confirm the diagnosis. A microscopic subtype known as vascular leiomyoma (angio- leiomyoma) has numerous thick-walled vessels associated

• Figure 7-40 Leiomyosarcoma, high grade composed of spindle cells with atypical nuclei.
with well-differentiated smooth muscle cells. Leiomyomas are surgically excised, and recurrence is unexpected.
Oral leiomyosarcomas have been reported in all age groups and in most intraoral regions. Microscopic diagnosis is a considerable challenge because of similarities to other spindle cell sarcomas. As with benign neoplasms, immuno- histochemistry can be a valuable diagnostic tool to demon- strate the expression of actin proteins. Actin is a small cyto- plasmic filament, approximately 5 nm in diameter that has contractile properties. Six actin isotypes differentiate smooth muscle, striated muscle, and nonmuscle cells. Anti–muscle-specific actin and anti–smooth muscle actin generally provide good sensitivity and intensity for the detection of leiomyosarcoma. Staining for desmin is less reliable, as it is positive in about two thirds of cases.
Leiomyosarcomas are usually treated with wide surgi- cal excision. Metastasis to lymph nodes or lung is not uncommon.
Rhabdomyoma and Rhabdomyosarcoma
Rhabdomyomas are rare lesions, but they have a predilec- tion for the soft tissues of the head and neck. The oral sites most frequently reported are floor of the mouth, soft palate, tongue, and buccal mucosa. The mean age of patients is about 50 years, and the age range extends from children to older adults. Presentation occurs as an asymptomatic, well- defined submucosal mass.
Two microscopic variants are recognized. In the adult type, neoplastic cells closely mimic their normal counter- parts (Figure 7-41); in the fetal type, neoplastic cells are elongated and less differentiated and exhibit fewer cross- striations. The latter type may be confused with rhabdo- myosarcoma. Treatment consists of excision, and recurrence is unlikely.
Rhabdomyosarcomas are subdivided into three principal microscopic forms: embryonal, alveolar, and pleomorphic. The first two types occur in children, and the latter type occurs principally in adults. The embryonal type consists of
   181

182 CHAPTER 7
Connective Tissue Lesions
 • Figure 7-41 Rhabdomyoma mimicking adult skeletal muscle cells.
primitive round cells in which striations are rarely found (Figure 7-42). Two subtypes are recognized: spindle cell and botryoid types. Both confer an excellent prognosis. The alveolar variant is composed of round cells but in a com- partmentalized pattern. The pleomorphic type, the best differentiated, contains strap or spindle cells that often exhibit cross-striations (Figure 7-43).
When it occurs in the head and neck, rhabdomyosar- coma is found primarily in children. When it occurs out- side the head and neck, it is seen typically in adults. Rhab- domyosarcoma presents as a rapidly growing mass that may cause pain or paresthesia if jaw involvement occurs. The most commonly affected oral sites are the tongue and soft palate. The embryonal type of rhabdomyosarcoma is the variety most commonly seen in the head and neck. Because of the relatively undifferentiated nature of this microscopic subtype, immunohistochemistry to demon- strate muscle-associated proteins (desmin, actin, myo- genin, myoD1) is typically used to support light micro- scopic interpretations. Two consistent and reproducible chromosome translocations are associated with alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. The most common is t(12;13) (q35;q14), and t(1;13)(p36q14) is less common. These
translocations juxtapose the PAX3 or PAX7 gene on chro- mosomes 2 and 1, respectively, with the FKHR gene on chromosome 13, resulting in chimeric fusion proteins that act as potent transcription factors. This process differs from the deletions on 11p15 that are seen in the embryonal forms of rhabdomyosarcoma.
The combination of surgery, radiation, and chemother- apy has been shown to produce far better clinical results than any one of these treatment methods alone. Survival rates have increased from less than 10% to better than 70% with this more aggressive treatment approach.
Fat Lesions
Lipoma
Lipomas are uncommon neoplasms that may occur in any region of the oral cavity. The buccal mucosa, tongue, and floor of the mouth are among the more common loca- tions (Figure 7-44). Lesions typically present clinically as asymptomatic, yellowish submucosal masses. The overly- ing epithelium is intact, and superficial blood vessels are usually evident over the tumor. Other benign connective tissue lesions such as granular cell tumors, neurofibromas, traumatic fibromas, and salivary gland lesions (mucocele and mixed tumor) might be included in a differential diagnosis.
Numerous microscopic subtypes have been described, but they are primarily of academic interest. All types have adipocytes of various degrees of maturity. The usual simple lipoma consists of a well-circumscribed, lobulated mass of mature fat cells. The lesions are excised and are not expected to recur.
Liposarcoma
Liposarcoma is rarely encountered in soft tissues of the head and neck. It is a lesion of adulthood and may potentially occur at any site. It usually develops slowly and may be mis- taken for a benign process. Considerable microscopic varia- tion in these malignancies has led to subclassification into at

least four types: well differentiated, myxoid, round cell, and pleomorphic. Apart from the expression of CD34, immuno- histochemistry plays little role in the diagnosis of liposar- coma. The degree of tumor cell differentiation coupled with identification of the microscopic subtype is an important factor in predicting clinical behavior (Figure 7-45). These neoplasms may be treated with surgery or radiation, and the prognosis is fair to good.

Mucocele is a clinical term that includes both mucus ex- travasation phenomenon and mucus retention cyst. Because each has a distinctive pathogenesis and microscopy, they are considered separately. Ranula is a clinical term that is used to describe a mucoele occurring in the floor of the mouth. Associated with the sublingual or submandibular glands, ranula presents as a fluctuant, unilateral, soft tissue mass. Because the mucosa in the floor of the mouth is thin, the superficially located pool of mucus produces a bluish swell- ing that has been likened to the appearance of a frog’s belly, hence the term ranula. When significantly large, it can
produce medial and superior deviation of the tongue. It may also cross the midline if the retained mucin dissects through the submucosa. A plunging ranula develops if mu- cus herniates inferiorly, dissecting through the mylohyoid muscle and along the fascial planes of the neck. On rare occasions, it may progress into the mediastinum.
Mucus Extravasation Phenomenon
Etiology and Pathogenesis
The cause of mucus extravasation phenomenon is traumatic severance of a salivary gland excretory duct, resulting in the escape of mucus, or extravasation, into the surrounding connective tissue (Figure 8-1). An inflammatory reaction of

neutrophils followed by the accumulation of macrophages ensues. Granulation tissue forms a wall around the mucin pool, and the associated salivary gland undergoes inflamma- tory change. Ultimately, scarring occurs in and around the gland.
Clinical Features
The lower lip is the most common site of mucus extravasa- tion phenomenon, but other sites subjected to trauma may be involved including the buccal mucosa, anterior-ventral surface of the tongue (location of the mixed serous and mu- cous glands of Blandin-Nuhn), floor of the mouth, and retromolar region (Figures 8-2 and 8-3). Lesions are uncom- monly found in other intraoral regions where salivary glands are located, probably because of lower susceptibility to trauma. Mucocoeles of the upper lip are very uncommon, a site where salivary gland tumors are more likely. Adolescents and children are more commonly affected than adults.
Mucus extravasation phenomenon presents as a relatively painless smooth surfaced mass ranging in size from a few millimeters to 2 cm in diameter. When the mucin is super- ficially located, the lesion has a bluish color. The maximum size is usually reached within several days after injury, and a viscous mucoid material is found if aspiration is attempted.
• Figure 8-2 Mucus extravasation phenomenon of the lower lip.
• Figure 8-3 Superficial mucocele of the palate.
Superficial mucocele is a variant of the extravasation- type mucocele. Rather than arising from traumatic duct rupture, this form of mucocele is believed to arise as a result of increased pressure in the outermost part of the excretory duct. These lesions are asymptomatic and numerous, occur- ring most commonly in the retromolar area, soft palate, and posterior buccal mucosa. Their clinical appearance suggests a vesiculobullous disease, but the lesions persist for an ex- tended time. Other than being a diagnostic challenge, they are of little significance.
Histopathology
Extravasation of mucin into the connective tissues incites an inflammatory response with neutrophils, macrophages, and granulation tissue forming around the mucin pool (Figure 8-4). The adjacent salivary gland whose duct was transected shows duct dilation, chronic inflammation, aci- nar degeneration, and interstitial fibrosis.
Differential Diagnosis
Although a history of a traumatic event followed by develop- ment of a bluish translucent mass is characteristic of the mucus extravasation phenomenon, other lesions might be considered when a typical history is absent. These include a
• Figure 8-4 Mucus extravasation phenomenon showing free mucin (top) surrounded by inflamed granulation and connective tissue and salivary gland tissue.
  
www.konkur.in
salivary gland neoplasm (especially a low-grade mucoepider- moid carcinoma), vascular malformation, venous varix, and soft tissue neoplasm such as neurofibroma or lipoma. Rarely, a mucocele may appear in the alveolar mucosa of the maxilla or mandible and in this situation an eruption cyst or gingival cyst should be included in the differential diagnosis.
Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment for the mucus extravasation phenomenon con- sists of surgical excision. Aspiration of the fluid content provides no lasting clinical benefit because the causative salivary gland will continue to produce saliva. Therefore removal of associated minor salivary glands along with the pooled mucus is necessary to prevent recurrence. No treat- ment is required for superficial mucoceles because they rupture spontaneously and are short-lived.
Mucus Retention Cyst (Obstructive Sialadenitis)
Etiology and Pathogenesis
Mucus retention cysts usually result from obstruction of salivary flow caused most commonly by a sialolith (Box 8-1). The sialolith(s) may be found anywhere in the ductal sys- tem, from the gland parenchyma to the excretory duct orifice. A sialolith (calculus or stone) is the precipitation of calcium salts (predominantly calcium carbonate and cal- cium phosphate) around a central nidus of cellular debris, inspissated mucin, and/or bacteria. Predisposition includes salivary stasis, chronic sialadenitis, and gout (uric acid
Etiology
Most are caused by obstruction by a salivary stone (sialolith). Stones form by accumulation of calcium salts around a nidus
within salivary duct.

mor may cause the obstructive sialadenitis.
Clinical Features
Most cases (up to 80%) of obstructive sialadenitis are associ- ated with sialoliths in the submandibular glands (Figures 8-5 and 8-6). About 20% are seen in the parotid glands, and a very small percentage is seen in sublingual and minor glands (especially upper lip).
Recurrent swelling and pain are the primary clinical features, with worsening at mealtime. Infection may or may not be present. A purulent, cloudy-to-flocculent discharge at the duct orifice when massaged, as well as limited flow from the gland at rest, is a common finding. Mucin in the floor-of-mouth lesions may dissect through the mylohyoid muscle that separates the sublingual from the submandibu- lar space to create a swelling in the neck called a plunging ranula.
Mucus retention cysts of the minor salivary glands typi- cally present as asymptomatic swellings without antecedent trauma. Varying in size from 3 to 10 mm, they are mobile and nontender on palpation. The overlying mucosa is intact and has normal color.
Radiographically, nearly 90% of submandibular sialo- liths are radiopaque, whereas most parotid stones (90%) are radiolucent. The diagnosis may be suggested or confirmed by routine radiographs, retrograde sialography, or by cross- sectional CT imaging.

Histopathology
The cyst-like cavity (“pseudocyst”) of a mucus retention cyst is lined by normal ductal epithelium that may range from pseudostratified to stratified squamous or occasionally on- cocytic (Figure 8-7). The cyst-like lumen contains mucin obstructed by a sialolith. The connective tissue around the lesion is minimally inflamed, although the associated gland shows inflammatory-obstructive change.
Differential Diagnosis
Salivary gland neoplasms, mucus extravasation phenome- non, and benign connective tissue neoplasms should be included in a clinical differential diagnosis. Dermoid cyst might also be included for lesions in the floor of the mouth, particularly if the lesion traverses the midline. Differentia- tion from a calcified phlebolith may be necessary, depend- ing on the clinical presentation. Phleboliths show a circular morphology, with multiple calcifications often present beyond the glandular drainage system.
• Figure 8-7 Sialolith (top) in a minor salivary gland (bottom) excre- tory duct of the upper lip.
Treatment and Prognosis
For minor salivary glands, treatment consists of removal of both the mucus retention cyst and the associated gland to avoid postoperative mucus extravasation phenomenon, which may occur if only the cystic component is removed or decompressed. Lesions of the major salivary glands are treated in a similar way if the stone(s) resides in the hilum of the ductal system. If the stone is in the distal part of the ductal system, the sialolith may be surgically removed or may be milked through the duct orifice. If a duct is surgi- cally entered, special precautions (marsupialization/ cannula) are used to aid the healing process, so that duct scarring is minimized. Constriction of the duct through excessive scar formation could result in obstruction or re- currence. Recurrence is noted in up to 20% of cases follow- ing routine treatment.
Maxillary Sinus Mucocoele (Retention Cyst and Pseudocyst)
Mucocoeles of the maxillary sinus lining are common, inci- dental findings on panoramic radiographs that rarely pro- duce any symptoms and are of little clinical significance.
Etiology and Pathogenesis
Retention cysts are thought to arise from blockage of an antral seromucous gland, resulting in a ductal epithelium-lined cys- tic structure filled with mucin. Pseudocysts are inflammatory in origin and result from fluid accumulation within the sinus membrane. They may be related to infection or allergy. Bacte- rial toxins, anoxia, and other factors presumably cause leakage of protein into surrounding soft tissue, thus raising the extra- vascular osmotic pressure with a subsequent fluid increase.
Clinical Features
A great majority of these lesions are asymptomatic, al- though some slight tenderness may be noted in the
• Figure 8-6 A, Ranula on the floor of the mouth. B, Plunging ranula.
  
www.konkur.in
mucobuccal fold or, more rarely, palpable buccal expan- sion in this region. On panoramic and periapical radio- graphs, retention cysts and pseudocysts of the maxillary sinus are hemispheric, homogeneously opaque, and well delineated (Figure 8-8). They usually demonstrate an at- tachment to the floor of the antrum, with size, rather than duration, being a function of the anatomic space. In contrast to odontogenic lesions, sinus mucocoeles arise from the sinus lining, and therefore there is no bone on the surface. Uncommonly, these lesions may appear bilaterally.
Histopathology
The pathogenesis of the two forms of antral cysts is reflected in the histologic appearance. The retention cyst is lined by pseudostratified columnar epithelium with occasional inter- spersed mucous cells. The supportive elements are mini- mally inflamed. The pseudocyst shows no evidence of an epithelial lining but, rather, pools of mucoid material sur- rounded by slightly compressed connective tissue. A mixed inflammatory infiltrate is present within the granulation tissue wall, and numerous mucus-containing macrophages are present within the mucin pool.
Differential Diagnosis
A clinical differential diagnosis of sinus mucocele in- cludes inflammatory polyps, hyperplasia of the sinus lining as a result of odontogenic infection, maxillary sinusitis, and neoplasms arising within the soft tissues of the antral lining.
Treatment
Maxillary sinus retention cysts and pseudocysts generally are left untreated because they show limited growth, are not destructive, and usually rupture spontaneously or slowly resolve. Therefore only periodic observation is required.
Necrotizing Sialometaplasia
Necrotizing sialometaplasia is a reactive condition typi- cally affecting the palate and rarely other sites containing salivary glands (Box 8-2). Recognition is important be- cause necrotizing sialometaplasia mimics malignancy both clinically and microscopically. Unnecessary surgery has been performed because of an erroneous preoperative di- agnosis of squamous cell carcinoma or mucoepidermoid carcinoma.
Etiology and Pathogenesis
The initiating event of necrotizing sialometaplasia is be- lieved to be ischemia of salivary glands induced by local trauma, surgical manipulation, or local anesthesia. Infarc- tion of the gland follows with squamous metaplasia of ductal remnants. Patients often have no recollection of prior traumatic event, although some cases may be caused

by local anesthetic placement in the area where necrotizing sialometaplasia develops.
Clinical Features
Intraorally, necrotizing sialometaplasia is most common at the junction of the hard and soft palates (Figure 8-9). Early in its evolution, the lesion may be noted as a tender swell- ing, often with a dusky erythema of the overlying mucosa. Subsequently, the mucosa breaks down, and there is a sharply demarcated deep ulcer with a yellowish gray lobular base. In the palate, the lesion may be unilateral or bilateral, with individual lesions ranging from 1 to 3 cm in diameter. Pain is generally disproportionately slight compared with the size of the lesion. Healing is generally protracted, taking from 6 to 10 weeks.

There is necrosis of salivary glands and squamous metaplasia of salivary duct epithelium at the base of an ulcer (Figure 8-10). The lobular architecture of salivary glands is preserved and this feature helps to distinguish this process from neoplasia. The squamous metaplasia may be misinterpreted as squa- mous cell carcinoma, but unlike cancer, there is no cyto- logic atypia. Likewise, when this metaplasia is seen in the
• Figure 8-9 Necrotizing sialometaplasia of the hard palate.
presence of residual viable salivary gland, the lesion may be mistaken for mucoepidermoid carcinoma.
Differential Diagnosis
Clinically, squamous cell carcinoma and malignant minor salivary gland neoplasms must be ruled out, usually by a biopsy. Syphilitic gummas and deep fungal infections like- wise must be ruled out because they may present as punched-out lesions of the palate. Findings from serology, biopsy, and/or culture are usually needed to exclude these entities. In medically compromised patients, such as those with poorly controlled diabetes, opportunistic fungal infec- tions such as mucormycosis may cause a similar clinical picture.
The entity of subacute necrotizing sialadenitis has been described as a nonspecific, inflammatory condition of mi- nor salivary glands of unknown origin. It is characterized by abrupt onset of pain and localized swelling, usually of the hard or soft palate, but, unlike necrotizing sialometa- plasia, it is self-limiting and has no ulcerative or metaplas- tic components.
Treatment and Prognosis
This is a benign, self-limiting process that, apart from a bi- opsy to establish the diagnosis, does not require surgical intervention. Healing takes place over several weeks by sec- ondary intention. Patient reassurance, wound irrigation using a bland baking soda-and-water mouth rinse, and oc- casional use of analgesics are the only management steps necessary.
Adenomatoid Hyperplasia
Adenomatoid hyperplasia is a non-neoplastic enlargement of the minor salivary glands of the hard palate. The cause is unknown, although evidence suggests that trauma may play a role.
Clinical Features
The palate is the principal site of involvement of this sali- vary gland hyperplasia. Males 24 to 63 years are most com- monly affected. The clinical presentation is a unilateral,

asymptomatic broad-based swelling of the hard and/or soft palate covered with intact mucosa of normal color and quality.
Histopathology
There are lobules of hypertrophic otherwise normal- appearing mucous glands. Individual acinar clusters are more numerous and larger than normal. Ducts exhibit a slight increase in relative prominence. The cytologic and morphologic features of acinar and ductal elements are within normal limits.
Differential Diagnosis
The clinical differential diagnosis would include salivary neoplasm, lymphoma, and extension of nasopharyngeal or sinonasal disease into the oral cavity. Periapical inflamma- tory disease should be excluded.
Treatment and Prognosis
Subsequent to diagnosis by incisional biopsy, no treatment is necessary, given the purely benign nature of this process. There is no neoplastic potential.
Infectious Sialadenitis
Mumps
Mumps is an infectious, acute viral sialadenitis primarily affecting the parotid glands. Before the widespread use of a successful vaccine, it was once considered the most com- mon of all salivary gland diseases with a year-round en- demic pattern, punctuated by seasonal peaks in the late winter and spring months. Mumps remains a significant health threat in developing countries, and outbreaks still occur sporadically in developed countries particularly where vaccine compliance is lower.
Etiology and Pathogenesis
The causative agent of infectious mumps is a paramyxo- virus. Transmission occurs by direct contact with salivary droplets with a 2- to 3-week incubation period preceding clinical symptoms.
Clinical Features
Affected patients develop fever, malaise, headache, and chills, in addition to preauricular pain. Parotid swelling tends to be asymmetric at the outset, reaching maximum proportions within 2 to 3 days. In 70% of cases there is bilateral parotid involvement. Severe local pain is often noted, especially on movement of the jaws in talking and chewing. Stensen’s duct may become partially occluded as the gland swells, with sharp pain resulting from stimu- lation of the secretory mechanism by food or drink. Perceptible diminution of swelling is noted approxi- mately 10 days after the onset of symptoms. Potentially serious complications (orchitis or oophoritis) can occur in adults. Mumps is a systemic infection, as evidenced by the widespread involvement of glandular and other
CHAPTER 8 Salivary Gland Diseases tissues in the body, including the liver, pancreas, kidney,
and nervous system.
Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment is symptomatic and includes bed rest. Analgesics are prescribed, and corticosteroids may be used in severe cases. Complete recovery is generally the rule, although viral encephalitis, myocarditis, and nephritis may lead to rare fatalities. Nerve deafness and bilateral testicular atrophy have been noted but are uncommon. The MMR or MMRV vaccine given to infants at 12 to 15 months of age and again at age 4 to 6 years contains a live attenuated vaccine against mumps that is highly effective at preventing the disease. Antibody conversion occurs in approximately 80% to 90% of individuals, and immunity is lifelong.
Although mumps is the most common form of viral sial- adenitis, parotitis may be caused by other viral agents, includ- ing Coxsackie A virus, echovirus, choriomeningitis virus, cytomegalovirus, and parainfluenza virus types 1 and 2.
Cytomegaloviral Sialadenitis
Cytomegaloviral infection of the salivary glands, or cytome- galic inclusion disease, is a rare condition that affects neo- nates as a result of transplacental infection. Systemic disease may cause debilitation, developmental retardation, and premature birth.
When encountered in adults who are immunocompro- mised (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infec- tion, organ transplantation recipients), infection may cause fever, salivary gland enlargement, hepatosplenomegaly, pneumonitis, and lymphocytosis. Retinitis can be a serious complication of this infection. Cytomegalovirus can be demonstrated in biopsy material; with the use of in situ hybridization methods, its presence can be easily confirmed in tissue sections. Oral aphthous-like ulcers, particularly those arising in immunocompromised patients, may con- tain the virus, but its importance is undetermined. In se- verely infected immunocompromised patients, ganciclovir may be used to control cytomegaloviral infection.
Adults who are not immunosuppressed may also be in- fected with cytomegalovirus, as evidenced by the high prevalence (,50%) of antibodies in the population. Sero- positivity tends to increase with age. Symptoms may be nonexistent, or slight to debilitating fever and malaise may occur. The significance of cytomegaloviral infection in the general population is uncertain.
Bacterial Sialadenitis
Etiology and Pathogenesis
Bacterial infections of salivary glands generally are due to microbial overgrowth in association with a reduction in sali- vary flow. Such reduction in flow may be noted subsequent to dehydration, postoperative states, and debilitation. Tradi- tionally, bacterial sialadenitis was a common postoperative complication of surgery related to inadequate hydration. Numerous drugs associated with a decreased salivary flow rate contribute to infections of the major salivary glands,

Salivary Gland Diseases
especially the parotid. Submandibular gland sialadenitis is far less common than its parotid counterpart, in part because of the stated higher degree of bactericidal quality and the greater viscosity of submandibular saliva versus the serous and lower viscosity quality of parotid fluid. Other possible causes in- clude trauma to the duct system and hematogenous spread of infection from other areas. The most commonly isolated or- ganisms in parotitis are penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus au- reus, Streptococcus viridans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Esche- richia coli, and Haemophilus influenzae. Anaerobic organisms may be cultured from acute cases and include Porphyromon- ans gingivalis. It is of interest to note the marked reduction in the overall incidence of acute parotitis after antibiotic prepa- rations are introduced. As resistant strains of bacteria have appeared, the prevalence of acute parotitis has increased.
Clinical Features
Clinical features of acute parotitis include the sudden onset of painful lateral facial swelling, low-grade fever, malaise, and headache. Laboratory studies disclose an elevated eryth- rocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and leukocytosis, often with a characteristic shift to the left, where neutrophil counts are elevated, indicating acute infection. The involved gland is extremely tender, and the patient often demon- strates guarding during examination. Trismus is often noted, and purulence at the duct orifice may be produced by gentle pressure on the involved gland or duct. If the infection is not eliminated early, suppuration may extend beyond the limit- ing capsule of the parotid gland. Extension into surrounding tissues along fascial planes in the neck or extension posteri- orly into the external auditory canal may follow.
Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment is directed at eliminating the causative organism through antibiotic therapy, rehydration and drainage of purulence, if present. Culture and sensitivity testing of the exudate at the orifice of the duct is the first step in antibiotic management. After a culture is obtained, all patients should empirically be placed on a regimen of a penicillinase- resistant antibiotic. Along with rehydration and attempts at establishing and encouraging salivary flow, moist warm compresses, analgesics, and rest are in order. Medications that reduce salivary flow such as those containing parasym- pathomimetics should be reduced or eliminated.
Biopsy and retrograde sialography should be avoided because of the risk of sinus tract formation and extension of infection into surrounding soft tissues. With prompt and effective treatment of acute infection, recurrence is gener- ally avoided. In cases of chronic recurrent parotitis, sialad- enectomy, particularly in cases of submandibular gland in- volvement, may be considered, although duct ligation and parotidectomy remain treatment options.
In the juvenile variant of parotitis, intermittent unilateral or bilateral painful swelling is accompanied by fever and malaise. The initial attack usually occurs in individuals be- tween ages 2 and 6 years, with numerous recurrences there- after. A neonatal form of suppurative parotitis develops
rarely, with S. aureus being the most common causative pathogen. Gross destruction of parenchymal and ductal ele- ments may be noted on sialogram. Absence of secretory acini and a damaged ductal system with numerous punctate globular spaces may be noted. Spontaneous regeneration of parotid salivary tissue has been reported in this condition. Finally, in contradistinction to adult Sjögren’s syndrome, bilateral parotitis is the most common presenting symptom of pediatric or juvenile Sjögren’s syndrome.
Sarcoidosis
Etiology
Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease of unde- termined origin (Box 8-3). It has been suggested that the disease represents an infection or a hypersensitivity response to atypical mycobacteria in a genetically susceptible indi- vidual. Mycobacterial DNA and RNA have been identified in some lesions, raising the possibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis or a related atypical mycobacteria as a causative agent. Alternate proposed microbial causes include Propi- onibacteria and Epstein-Barr and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) viruses.
Patients with some histocompatibility antigens (HLA- A1, HLA-B8, HLA-DR3, HLA-DRB1) may have a greater incidence of sarcoidosis than others. It has also been found that most patients with sarcoidosis are anergic, demonstrat- ing decreased levels of cutaneous sensitization to dinitro- chlorobenzene, as well as to tuberculin, mumps virus, Candida antigen, and pertussis antigen.
Clinical Features
Although the protean manifestations of this disease includ- ing the pulmonary effects are well known, the diagnosis remains one of exclusion. The clinical course ranges from spontaneous resolution to chronic progression. The disease may affect individuals at any age, although most are affected in the second through fourth decades. Females show a

higher incidence than males, and blacks are more com- monly affected than whites.
Patients may complain of lethargy, chronic fatigue, and anorexia, with specific signs and symptoms related to the organ involved. Pulmonary manifestations are most characteristic of this disease. They are typified by bilat- eral, hilar, and, less commonly, paratracheal lymphade- nopathy. The disease may stabilize at this point, or it may advance to pulmonary fibrosis with subsequent develop- ment of pulmonary hypertension, respiratory failure, and cor pulmonale.
The skin may be involved in approximately 25% of cases; most commonly, erythema nodosum characterized by nontender, dark purple, elevated areas on the limbs, abdo- men, and buttocks may appear. Another form of cutaneous pathology includes lesions known as lupus pernio, a term used to describe symmetric, infiltrative, violaceous plaques on the nose, cheeks, ears, forehead, and hands.
Ocular involvement is variable, with inflammation of the anterior uveal tract most commonly seen. This may be associated with granulomatous lesions in the parotid gland producing swelling and fever, referred to as uveoparotid fever or Heerfordt’s syndrome.
Hepatic involvement is common, with approximately 60% of patients showing granulomatous lesions on liver biopsy specimens. However, clinical evidence of hepatic involvement in the form of abnormal liver function tests is present in less than 50% of patients.
Osseous lesions are uncommon, with a reported preva- lence of 5% reported. When present, punched-out lesions involving the distal phalanges with erosions of cancellous bone and an intact cortex are seen. Destruction of alveolar bone with tooth mobility may be evident within the maxilla and the mandible.
Within the mouth, sarcoidosis may present as nodular swellings of the buccal mucosa and vestibule similar to those seen in another granulomatous disorder Crohn’s disease. The lips may also be affected, producing diffuse or nodular swell- ing. Parotid swelling may occur unilaterally or bilaterally with about equal frequency (Box 8-4). Other salivary glands may also be involved in the granulomatous inflammatory

process, leading to xerostomia. Sarcoidosis may be present as the triad of recurring facial paralysis, swelling of the lips (usually upper), and a fissured tongue, which is a condition termed Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. Other sites in the aerodigestive tract may be involved, with lesions developing in the nasal mucosa, especially in the inferior turbinate and septal regions. Granulomas may occur in the nasal sinuses, pharynx, epiglottis, and larynx.
Serum chemistry, radiographic studies, and biopsy are useful laboratory tests. Serum chemistry studies should include calcium (for evidence of hypercalcemia) and angio- tensin 1–converting enzyme, lysozyme, and adenosine de- aminase levels (for evidence of macrophage activity within granulomas). Gallium scintiscanning and routine chest radiographs and intraoral films may be used to demonstrate bone involvement.
Histopathology
A consistent microscopic finding in sarcoidosis is the devel- opment of noncaseating granulomas (Figure 8-11). Within the granulomas are epithelioid macrophages and multinu- cleated giant cells, which may contain stellate inclusions (asteroid bodies) and concentrically laminar calcifications (Schaumann bodies). A diffuse lymphocytic infiltrate may be seen around the periphery of the granulomas. The case- ation-type necrosis that is typical of tuberculosis is absent. Conventional histochemical stains fail to identify microor- ganisms such as acid-fast bacilli. A lip biopsy may occasion- ally provide evidence of granulomatous involvement of minor salivary glands.
Diagnosis
There is no specific test for sarcoidosis. Historically, the Kveim test (Nickerson-Kveim or Kveim-Siltzbach test) was used to diagnose sarcoidosis. The test would inject into the skin a portion of spleen from a patient known to have sarcoidosis and determine whether noncaseating granulo- mas develop at the injection site in 4 to 6 weeks. The test was frequently unreliable and there was the inherent risk of patient cross-infection and therefore it is no longer used. Several serum markers may be helpful to support the

diagnosis but none are specific. Angiotensin 1–converting enzyme is frequently elevated in sarcoidosis but can also be abnormally elevated in several other conditions such as miliary tuberculosis, leprosy, hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, primary biliary cirrhosis, and multiple myeloma.
The histologic differential diagnosis includes tuberculo- sis, Crohn’s disease, leprosy, cat-scratch disease, fungal in- fection (blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, and histoplas- mosis), and parasitic diseases such as toxoplasmosis. Granulomas seen in association with beryllium and talc exposure must also be considered.
Treatment and Prognosis
Spontaneous resolution occurs in a significant number of patients (65%-70%) with few to no signs of residua or chronic sequelae. Corticosteroids are generally considered beneficial in the acute phase and remain the drugs of choice in treating symptomatic pulmonary sarcoidosis. Other agents may be used in addition to or instead of corticoste- roids. Chloroquine, given alone or in combination with corticosteroids, has been found useful in the management of this disease. Immunosuppressive drugs have been used with good results in individuals not responding to cortico- steroid management. A management role for thalidomide and infliximab (a TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody) has been identified as well. Immunomodulators such as levami- sole may be useful in the management of arthritic symp- toms caused by sarcoidosis.
In general, the prognosis for sarcoidosis is good, but patients must be monitored periodically with chest radio- graphs and serum angiotensin 1–converting enzyme deter- minations to monitor burden of disease. Clinical relapses are unusual in cases in which spontaneous resolution has occurred.
Metabolic Conditions
A generic term for a group of metabolic disorders that may cause salivary gland enlargement is sialadenosis, or sialosis. These conditions usually affect the parotid glands bilater- ally, typically in the absence of inflammatory symptoms. Chronic alcoholism, dietary deficiency, obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, bulimia, anorexia nervosa, and hy- perlipidemia have been linked to this clinical salivary gland abnormality. Recently, alterations in aquaporin water chan- nel function have been implicated in the development of sialadenosis.
Asymptomatic enlargements of the parotid glands occur in 30% to 80% of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis or chronic alcoholism. Salivary gland enlargement has been at- tributed to chronic protein deficiency. Comparable parotid gland enlargement in individuals with liver cirrhosis result- ing from other causes apparently does not occur. Nutritional or protein deprivation may lead to a similar salivary gland enlargement.
In diabetes mellitus, reduced flow rates have been re- ported in addition to bilateral parotid gland enlargement. The mechanism of acinar hypertrophy in this condition is
unknown. Reduced flow rates from the parotid and other major salivary glands may lead to increased risk of bacterial sialadenitis.
In cases of type I hyperlipoproteinemia, a sicca-like syn- drome has been described. This is characterized primarily by parotid enlargement with mild oral or ocular sicca symp- toms; it is generally attributed to the presence of fatty re- placement of functional salivary gland parenchyma.
Another endocrine-related salivary gland enlargement may be noted in acromegaly. This might be a reflection of a generalized organomegaly encountered in this endocrine- mediated disturbance. Apparent parotid enlargement (aci- nar hypertrophy) and increased levels of parotid flow have been noted in patients with chronic relapsing pancreatitis.
Sjögren’s Syndrome
Sjögren’s syndrome is an autoimmune disorder that, through lymphocyte-mediated destruction of lacrimal and salivary gland parenchyma, produces the characteristic symptoms of dry eyes (keratoconjunctivitis sicca) and dry mouth (xero- stomia) (Box 8-5). Other autoimmune conditions, particu- larly rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, and sclero- derma, may also be associated with this disorder. Traditionally, the disease was divided into primary Sjögren’s syndrome in instances of only exocrine glandular involve- ment and secondary Sjögren’s syndrome if an associated connective tissue disorder such as rheumatoid arthritis was present, in addition to the xerostomia and keratoconjuncti- vitis sicca. This distinction between primary and secondary forms of Sjögren’s syndrome was based on an early definition of the disease and is now likely obsolete. With the introduction of objective measures of systemic disease, the identification of the many systemic components of primary Sjögren’s syndrome, and the many autoimmune diseases that can occur with other autoimmune connective

tissue diseases, it is increasingly clear that there is little use distinguishing a patient’s one autoimmune disease as secondary to another.
Etiology
Although the specific cause of this syndrome is unknown, it is considered a multifactorial process. Numerous immuno- logic alterations indicating a disease of great complexity characterized in part by environmental factors and a suscep- tible host results in a generalized immune dysregulation as noted by polyclonal B-cell hyperactivity reflecting lack of regulation by T-cell subpopulations. Specific immune sys- tem abnormalities include enhanced activity of the type 1 interferon system with subsequent upregulation of B-cell– activating factor. Other possible etiologic factors include altered autonomic activity of the affected glands and antimuscarinic receptor autoantibody production with re- sultant type 3 receptor dysfunction. As with the benign (salivary) lymphoepithelial lesion, the specific causes of this immunologic defect remain speculative.
Viruses, particularly retroviruses and Epstein-Barr virus, have been implicated in the development of Sjögren’s syn- drome, but none are proven causes. Epstein-Barr virus has been demonstrated in the salivary gland tissue of patients with Sjögren’s syndrome. However, this virus has also been found in the salivary glands of normal individuals, thus weakening the contention that Epstein-Barr virus has a primary role in causing this condition. If Epstein-Barr virus is involved, its role is likely secondary in nature.
Initial steps in the development of disease involve paren- chymal vascular endothelium, acinar cells, and mesenchy- mal elements, including dendritic cells, by way of type 1 interferon production, allowing homing and long-term re- tention and localization of organ-specific lymphocytes in the area. Alterations of out-in messaging between stromal and epithelial elements by way of stromal metalloproteinase activity are also believed to play an important role in the early phases of pathogenesis, as well as in apoptosis of acinar cells via FAS-FAS ligand interaction, granzyme A forma- tion, elaboration of perforin, and engagement of Toll recep- tors and interferon production. The net result of cell surface and acinar cell perturbation may relate to membrane dys- function by way of aquaporin transport alteration, whereby water channel transport may be permanently altered.
Clinical Features
Sjögren’s syndrome occurs in all ethnic and racial groups. The peak age of onset is 50 years, and 90% of cases occur in women. Children and teenagers can be affected, but this is rare. The chief oral complaint in Sjögren’s syndrome is xerostomia, which may be the source of eating and speak- ing difficulties and also puts the patient at greater risk for dental caries, periodontal disease, and oral candidiasis. Parotid gland enlargement, often bilateral, occurs in ap- proximately 50% of patients (Figure 8-12). A significant percentage of patients also complain of arthralgia, myalgia, and fatigue.
• Figure 8-12 Sjögren’s syndrome patient with bilateral parotid swelling.
The salivary component of Sjögren’s syndrome may be assessed by sialochemical studies, nuclear imaging of the glands (scintigraphy), contrast sialography, flow rate analysis, and a minor salivary gland biopsy. The most com- monly used and most reliable method of assessing salivary alteration in this syndrome is a labial salivary gland biopsy (discussed later).
Nuclear medicine techniques using a technetium pertechnetate isotope and subsequent scintiscanning can yield functional information relative to uptake of the isotope by salivary gland tissue. Contrast sialography aids in detecting filling defects within the gland being exam- ined. A punctate sialectasia is characteristic in individuals with Sjögren’s syndrome. This latter finding reflects sig- nificant ductal and acinar damage, with only the inter- lobular ducts remaining in cases of moderate to advanced disease. Over time, with further parenchymal and ductal damage, focal areas of narrowing or stenosis of larger ducts takes place and may be seen on a sialogram. Other forms of sialectasia, including globular and cavitary types, may be noted.
Other laboratory findings commonly found in Sjögren’s syndrome include mild anemia, leukopenia, eosinophilia, an elevated ESR, and diffuse elevation of serum immunoglobulin levels. In addition, numerous autoantibodies may be found, including rheumatoid fac- tor, antinuclear antibodies, and precipitating antinuclear antibodies such as anti–Sjögren’s syndrome-A (SS-A) and anti–Sjögren’s syndrome-B (SS-B). Patients who have SS-B antibodies are more likely to develop extraglandu- lar disease.
Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common systemic auto- immune disease associated with Sjögren’s syndrome, although systemic lupus erythematosus is not infrequently encountered (Box 8-6). Less commonly, diseases such as scleroderma, pri- mary biliary cirrhosis, polymyositis, vasculitis, parotitis, and chronic active hepatitis may be associated with secondary Sjögren’s syndrome.

Histopathology
In individuals with Sjögren’s syndrome, a benign lymphocyte infiltrates the salivary gland parenchyma. The initial lesion is focal periductal aggregation of lymphocytes and occasionally plasma cells. As inflammatory foci enlarge, a corresponding level of acinar degeneration is seen (Figures 8-13 and 8-14). With increasing lymphocytic infiltration, confluence of in- flammatory foci occurs. Epimyoepithelial islands are present in major glands in approximately 40% of cases and are only
• Figure 8-13 Sjögren’s syndrome, minor salivary gland expression. Note lymphocytic focus adjacent to intact acini.
• Figure 8-14 Sjögren’s syndrome, minor salivary gland expression. Note confluent lymphocytic foci without evidence of scarring.
rarely seen in minor glands. A positive correlation in the pat- tern and extent of infiltration between labial salivary glands and submandibular and parotid glands is noted in patients with Sjögren’s syndrome.
An objective grading system has been developed for as- sessing the salivary component (lymphocytic sialadenitis) of Sjögren’s syndrome in labial salivary gland biopsy specimens. This method is an important part of current diagnostic clas- sification systems. A glandular area that contains 50 or more lymphocytes is designated as a focus. More than one focus in 4 mm2 is regarded as consistent with the salivary compo- nent of Sjögren’s syndrome. Interpretation of labial gland biopsy specimens should be done with the knowledge that infiltrates may be seen both in normal glands and in glands that are inflamed for other reasons, including myasthenia gravis, bone marrow transplantation, other connective tissue diseases, and obstructive phenomena.
A recently defined condition termed IgG4-related dis- ease can produce similar findings as seen in Sjogren’s syn- drome. IgG4-related disease is a rare fibro-inflammatory condition characterized by a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate rich in IgG41 plasma cells along with storiform fibrosis and—often but not always—elevated serum IgG4 concentrations. The number of IgG4-positive plasma cells per high-power field (HPF) that is regarded as consistent with IgG4-related disease varies from tissue to tissue. Gen- erally, the minimum for making the diagnosis for most tissues is from 30 to 50 IgG4-positive cells/HPF. Within salivary gland tissue the condition is characterized by an IgG41 population of plasma cells comprising at least 40% of the total or 100 IgG41 plasma cells per HPF. Chronic sclerosing sialadenitis (Kuttner tumor) is now recognized as a manifestation of IgG4-related disease.
Diagnosis
Traditionally the diagnosis depended on correlation be- tween patient history and laboratory data, clinical exami- nation, and assessment of salivary function. This combina- tion of patient symptomatology and objective findings often led to reproducibility and concurrence problems.
   
www.konkur.in
Based on cohort data from the Sjögren’s International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA), the American College of Rheumatology has published objective and vali- dated criteria for the diagnosis of Sjögren’s syndrome that show high levels of sensitivity and specificity. The diagnosis of Sjögren’s syndrome requires at least two of the following three features: 1) positive serum anti-SSA and/or anti-SSB or positive rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody titer .1:320; 2) ocular staining score by lissamine green .3; or 3) the presence of focal lymphocytic sialadenitis with a focus score .1 focus/4 mm2 in labial salivary gland biopsy.
Treatment
Sjögren’s syndrome and its complications are best managed symptomatically. Artificial saliva and oral lubricants as well as artificial tears are available for this purpose. Preventive oral measures are extremely important relative to xerosto- mia. Scrupulous oral hygiene, dietary modification, topical fluoride therapy, and remineralizing solutions are important in maintaining oral and dental tissues. Use of sialagogues, such as pilocarpine and cevimeline, remains of limited value, especially in long-standing Sjögren’s syndrome. Dietary con- siderations also are important, whereby the patient should avoid intake of caffeine-containing drinks and foods and limit consumption of cariogenic foods and drinks.
The prognosis of Sjögren’s syndrome is complicated by the associated development of marginal zone B-cell lym- phoma, which may occur in up to 5% of cases. Generally, the course for Sjögren’s syndrome is one of chronicity, requiring long-term symptomatic management. Careful follow-up and management by a dentist, ophthalmologist, and rheumatologist, among others, are critical. In cases of severe Sjögren’s syndrome with systemic complications, a promising treatment option is the use of anti-CD20 mono- clonal antibody (rituximab), although this has to be estab- lished in randomized control trials.
Salivary Lymphoepithelial Lesion
An uncommon cause of major salivary gland enlargement is the benign (salivary) lymphoepithelial lesion (BLEL). The condition presents as a persistent, nonpainful, firm, unilat- eral or bilateral mass in a major salivary gland. Although this lesion most commonly occurs in the setting of Sjögren’s syndrome, it has been reported in the absence of the disease. Histopathology classically shows effacement of salivary tis- sue by a dense infiltrate of lymphocytes and plasma cells. This is associated with proliferation of the ductal compo- nents to produce irregular islands of epithelium that are called epimyoepithelial islands.
Although the term benign lymphoepithelial lesion has enjoyed common usage, other terms, including myoepi- thelial sialadenitis and immunosialadenitis, have been suggested. Unfortunately, none of these appropriately re- flect the biology of this lesion, because studies of the natural history, histopathology, immunology, and molec- ular biology now support the concept that many are not
“benign” but, rather, represent occult lymphoma of the marginal zone B-cell type. Differentiation of benign lym- phoid infiltrate from low-grade malignant lymphoma is difficult in this setting and rests on the identification of lymphocyte monotypia by molecular or immunohisto- chemical methods. The term salivary lymphoepithelial lesion has been proposed as a more accurate descriptor of the basic pathologic lesion and its anatomic location without implicit reference to the underlying or potential biology of the disease.
Scleroderma
Scleroderma (systemic sclerosis) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that results in fibrosis and hardening of the skin. It has a wide spectrum of involvement from a limited cuta- neous form called morphea to a more extensive form that may also involve internal organs called systemic sclero- derma. The remainder of this discussion focuses on the systemic type. It often occurs in conjunction with other autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, and Sjögren’s syndrome. Rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies are typically demonstrable in patients with scleroderma. Hypergamma- globulinemia and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate are also noted. Along with an increased rate of collagen synthesis is the appearance of vascular changes. Inflamma- tory and obstructive changes are seen microscopically in arterioles and capillaries, supporting the notion that vessel changes are important in the pathogenesis of scleroderma. Also, Raynaud’s phenomenon, a peripheral vascular condi- tion, often precedes the other manifestations of the disease. Systemic scleroderma appears usually during middle age (30-50 years) and predominantly in women (4:1). No racial predilection has been noted.
Clinical Features
The disease is progression and can affect any organ system (Figures 8-15 to 8-17). The skin is typically affected first, although joint involvement may provide the initial sign. In time, as fibrosis of organs progresses, signs of organ failure begin to appear.
Cutaneous manifestations are typified by pitting edema early in the disease process, followed by tightness and rigid- ity of the skin. The skin eventually becomes indurated, smooth, and atrophic, with telangiectasias. The face be- comes expressionless and seems masklike. Fibrosis of the fingers leads to stiffness and atrophy of the skin over the digits. Vascular compromise may result in ischemia and ulceration of the fingertips, a phenomenon seen in both scleroderma and Raynaud’s phenomenon. The rigidity of the perioral skin causes restriction of the oral orifice mak- ing oral hygiene and routine dental care difficult. Fibrosis of the salivary glands gives rise to xerostomia and poten- tially to cervical caries. Mandibular bone resorption and uniformly widened periodontal membranes (as seen in periapical films) are also characteristic oral manifestations of this disease.

Laboratory testing may show the presence of one or sev- eral autoantibodies in the blood including anti-scl70, an antitopoisomerase, an anticentromere antibody and anti- U3 or anti-RNA polymerase antibodies. The types and patterns sometimes correlate with the clinical pattern of involvement of the disease.
Histopathology
The primary histologic feature of scleroderma is the deposi- tion of vast amounts of relatively acellular collagen. Perivas- cular lymphocytic infiltrates are also typical. Minor salivary gland changes include pronounced interstitial fibrosis and acinar atrophy.
Treatment
Systemic disease stabilizes in most patients after a time. Pa- tients with progressive disease are likely to succumb to renal, cardiac, or pulmonary failure. Other than supportive therapy, no satisfactory treatment is available for scleroderma. Corti- costeroids may provide some benefit early but are not likely to give lasting control in progressive cases. Immunosuppres- sive drugs such as azathioprine have shown some promise.
Xerostomia
Etiology
Dry mouth or xerostomia is a common condition defined as an overall reduction in salivary output. Many causes for xerostomia are known (Box 8-7), including anxiety,

autoimmune disease (Sjögren’s syndrome), diabetes mel- litus, chemotherapy, external beam radiotherapy to the oral and head and neck regions, radioactive iodine treat- ment for thyroid malignancy, and many commonly used medications that have anticholinergic effects. (See follow- ing section on taste disturbances.) The role of aging and of associated salivary dysfunction remains controversial; however, studies have postulated that, although a demon- strable secretory reserve is present to preserve function, an overall loss of acinar cells occurs with aging. Moreover, it has also been shown that xenogeneic drugs have an adverse impact on healthy older adults compared with younger adults, for whom secretory reserve is higher. From a dietary perspective, caffeine remains an important and the most commonly identified agent that contributes to xerostomia. In addition, the role of alcohol consump- tion must be recognized as a modifying factor in xerosto- mia. Transient dry mouth often may be a more subjective symptom, in particular in relation to various psychosocial factors and anxiety.
Clinical Features
The clinical presentation of xerostomia is the same regard- less of the cause. Patients complain of various symptoms, in particular difficulty in talking or swallowing, altered taste, generalized oral discomfort, and, if worn, poor retention of dentures. Usually, a reduction in salivary flow of more than 50% is required before clinical symptoms develop. Intraoral examination will reveal lack of saliva in the floor of mouth, and attempts to express saliva from the major salivary duct openings by external pressure on the gland may fail. In ad- dition to being reduced in amount, any saliva that is present may be frothy. Lack of saliva may be associated with gener- alized erythema of the oral mucosa and a lobulated appear- ance on the dorsum of the tongue. There is also likely to be evidence of candidiasis and angular cheilitis. The teeth are prone to cervical caries, and existing restorations may fail because of recurrent caries. Patients with xerostomia are predisposed to recurrent episodes of suppurative sialadeni- tis, particularly of the parotid gland.
The impact of chronic xerostomia is clinically significant because of associated difficulty in eating, speaking, and swallowing, and because of alterations in taste. The net re- sult often consists of diminished nutritional status, malnu- trition, and decreased social interaction. Also seen in asso- ciation with dry mouth are oral burning and mucosal soreness.
Treatment
Management of the patient with xerostomia is generally directed toward palliation and requires a careful multifacto- rial approach, wherein local and systemic factors are consid- ered, along with analysis of all prescription and over-the- counter medications and diet. Direct interventional strategies include the use of topical agents such as oral polymer-based sprays, so-called saliva substitutes, sipping of small amounts of water during the day, drug modification
when possible, elimination of caffeine-containing products, chewing of sugar-free gum, and elimination of alcohol- containing mouth rinses (Box 8-8). Obviously, excellent oral hygiene, topical fluoride application, and careful dental follow-up are required to help prevent or control dental caries. In some cases, cholinergic agonists including pilocar- pine and cevimeline may be helpful, as may the use of acupuncture.
Taste Disturbances
Taste or gustation relates to the perception of the five tradi- tional elements sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami (sa- vory) and their relationship to each other. In concert and in combination they form a flavor, derived from the collective sense of smell and trigeminal inputs of texture, tempera- ture, and pungency over surfaces of the tongue, oral cavity, and nasal cavity. The complex relationships between these components may become distorted, leading to disturbances in taste, including hypogeusia (blunted taste), ageusia (ab- sence of taste), cacogeusia (unpleasant or obnoxious taste associated with familiar previously acceptable foods), and dysgeusia (altered or incongruous taste perception or a per- sistent misinterpretation of normal taste sensation). Altera- tions in taste can be minimal and only slightly bothersome to incapacitating, with possible resultant depression and anorexia as secondary clinical events.
Although dental practitioners do not routinely perform qualitative testing of the basic taste modalities, thorough review of a patient’s medical and surgical history and careful oral examination may provide clues or direction concerning possible cause(s). Oral mucosal diseases, in- cluding candidiasis, must be addressed as important po- tential etiologic factors. Upper airway surgery (paranasal sinus procedures), viral infection, or neoplasia may alter olfactory function, thus secondarily affecting taste percep- tion. Tonsillectomy and orofacial-orthognathic surgical procedures may produce chorda tympani injury, thus

affecting at least one-sided taste function. Many diseases are capable of inducing taste aberrations (Box 8-9), as are representatives of several drug classes (Box 8-10). Habits, in particular moderate to heavy smoking and use of smokeless tobacco, have been associated with hypogeusia. Xerostomia, as a complication of anticholinergic drug use or as a component of Sjögren’s syndrome, may commonly produce an associated decrease in taste, possibly secondary to incomplete food solubilization, and by diminished transport of molecules to taste buds. This problem is often underreported within the elderly population as a result of polypharmacy on one hand and the direct effects of some drugs on taste sensation, and xenogeneic effects of drugs on the other, mimicking a Sjögren’s syndrome effect. Indi- viduals who have undergone radiation therapy to the oral and head and neck regions for malignant tumors often experience taste disturbances as a result of both direct damage to taste buds and salivary dysfunction. Finally, those complaining of idiopathic burning mouth syndrome commonly state a concomitant taste alteration, usually dysgeusia of the metallic to salty type.

Management of this problem remains difficult and lim- ited. Management of any metabolic or endocrine abnor- mality may realize resumption of normal taste function. Relative to drug-induced taste dysfunction, the use of vita- min and mineral replacement has been advocated, although with unpredictable and transient benefits. Consideration of switching of drugs known to interfere with taste alteration to an alternate class may be helpful. Evaluation of diag- nosed olfactory alterations, including anosmia or hyposmia, and management of such are important considerations in the treatment of any taste disturbance. For patients with demonstrable xerostomia, salivary stimulation with siala- gogues may be useful. Studies on idiopathic dysgeusia have demonstrated improvement with alpha lipoic acid therapy, suggesting a possible neuropathic axis, similar to that pro- posed in burning mouth syndrome, which occurs with ac- companying dysgeusia. In addition, patients must be coun- seled concerning their role in management. This includes several aspects of food intake such as increasing texture, maximizing smell, and avoiding food spoilage.
Halitosis
A common complaint in adults, halitosis (bad breath; fetor ex oris) is characterized by a wide variety of causes, with the possible inclusion of altered taste as a complaint as well. Although the precise incidence is not known, a preliminary report noted that up to 40% of adults do complain about this issue in the morning hours. It is more common in those with nasal obstruction or those who sleep in a hot, dry en- vironment. Up to 17% of adults state that halitosis is a concern at one time or another, and 1% or less indicate that their lives are disrupted as a result.
Halitosis originates chiefly from the mouth and less so from the nose, tonsils (tonsillitis, tonsilliths), and a wide variety of other sites (Box 8-11). Within the mouth, gingival and periodontal diseases are the most important drivers of malodor, where a specific periodontal pathogen, Porphyromo- nas gingivalis, is a known producer of methyl mercaptan. A broad range of medical conditions and factors can be related to the development or promotion of halitosis, including oral, oropharyngeal, and upper airway diseases; metabolic diseases; and dietary constituents including alcohol, tobacco, and sulfur-containing foods (onion and garlic, in particular). In cases of a negative evaluation and failure to confirm the pres- ence of halitosis by others in the patient’s family or friends, consideration must be given to the possibility of a hypochon- dria, or delusional halitosis.
An objective assessment on the part of the patient is difficult; a third party is often needed to confirm the pres- ence of malodor, its intensity at the time of evaluation, and comparison of the stated odor at other times. Variations in breath quality fluctuate with time of day and generally are related inversely to salivary flow rates. The concept of de- lusional halitosis is well-known and likely accounts for a significant portion of those who complain of oral malodor. When objectively assessed, these individuals are found not to have halitosis but remain unconvinced. Ultimately, no

organic oral disease will be found to account for their complaint.
Specific methods of breath analysis include the organo- leptic approach, coming from the mouth and nose, and comparing the two. Monitoring devices capable of detect- ing levels of sulfide and mercaptan compounds are available at specialty sites, as is the capability for microbiological as- sessment with darkfield techniques and testing for benzoyl- arginine-naphthylamide (BANA). Gas chromatographic analysis is considered the gold standard but is impractical within the routine patient care setting.
Management of halitosis includes routine dental treat- ment and proper oral hygiene measures, maintenance of removable prostheses, gentle surface cleaning of the pos- terior dorsum of the tongue, remaining hydrated, and avoiding consumption of foods containing sulfide com- pounds (Box 8-12). Mouth rinses containing chlorhexi- dine, chlorine dioxide, benzalkonium chloride, or zinc salts may have a role in management, but this is un- proven. Commercial mouthwashes contain high concen- trations of alcohol and flavoring agents and likely work only to temporarily camouflage malodor caused by or- ganic oral disease. The drying effects of alcohol on the oral mucosa ultimately may make the problem worse. Finally, after a thorough evaluation or treatment course

Benign Neoplasms
At approximately 5 weeks of embryonic development, a characteristic lobular architecture of salivary glands be- comes established. As branching morphogenesis continues, terminal tubular elements give rise to striated intralobular ducts, intercalated ducts, acini, and myoepithelial cells. Intralobular and interlobular ducts of the excretory system arise from the remaining progenitor stalk cells. Because of their relatively undifferentiated ultrastructural appearance, intercalated duct cells are thought to be capable of giving rise to these neoplasms. The importance of the myoepithe- lial cell in the composition and growth of numerous epithe- lial salivary tumors is considerable (Box 8-13). Cells with a myoepithelial phenotype can be seen in all salivary gland tumors and are particularly abundant in mixed tumors (pleomorphic adenoma), myoepitheliomas, adenoid cystic carcinomas, and epimyoepithelial carcinomas.
The three major paired salivary glands—parotid, sub- mandibular, and sublingual—plus the hundreds of small minor salivary glands located within the submucosa of the oral cavity and oropharynx are capable of giving rise to a wide range of neoplasms. A vast majority of salivary neo- plasms are epithelial/myoepithelial in origin; rarely, the in- terstitial connective tissue components of the major salivary glands give rise to primary neoplasms whose behavior is similar to that of their extraglandular counterparts.

ratio of benign to malignant salivary gland tumors is gland dependent (Table 8-1).
Mixed Tumor (Pleomorphic Adenoma)
The histogenesis of mixed tumor, or pleomorphic adenoma, relates to dual proliferation and comingling of cells with ductal or myoepithelial features in a stroma of mucoid, myxoid, and less commonly, chondroid quality. This sepa- rates it from monomorphic adenomas composed of only one cell type and a more homogeneous or less varied stroma. The myoepithelial-differentiated cell assumes an important role in determining the overall composition and appearance of mixed tumors. A range of cell types and microscopic patterns are seen in mixed tumors, those com- posed almost completely of epithelial (luminal) cells at one end of a spectrum and those composed almost completely of myoepithelial (abluminal) cells at the other end. Between these two extremes, less well developed cells with features of both myoepithelial and luminal elements may be seen. An alternative theory that a single cell with the potential to dif- ferentiate toward either epithelial or myoepithelial cells may be responsible for these tumors has been proposed.
Clinical Features
The mixed tumor is the most common tumor of the major and minor salivary glands (Box 8-14). The parotid gland accounts for approximately 85% of these tumors, whereas the submandibular gland and the intraoral minor salivary glands account for 8% and 7%, respectively. Mixed tumors occur at any age, favor males slightly more than females,
Salivary Gland Tumors
and are most prevalent in the fourth through sixth decades of life. They constitute approximately 50% of all intraoral minor salivary gland tumors. Generally, they are mobile, except when they occur in the hard palate. They appear as firm, painless swellings and, in the vast majority of cases, do not cause ulceration of the overlying mucosa (Figure 8-18). The palate is the most common intraoral site, followed by the upper lip and buccal mucosa.
When they arise within the parotid gland, mixed tu- mors are generally painless and slow-growing. They are usually located below the ear and posterior to the mandi- ble. They are smooth, firm, and mobile unless they achieve large size, when they may become multinodular or bosse- lated. Some tumors may be grooved by the posterior extent of the mandibular ramus, with long-standing lesions capable of producing pressure atrophy on this bone. When situated within the inferior pole or tail of the parotid, the tumors may present below the angle of the mandible and anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. When arising within the deep lobe of the parotid gland, tumors are nonpalpable and may present as a mass within the lateral pharyngeal wall.
Mixed tumors can range from a few millimeters to sev- eral centimeters in diameter and are capable of reaching giant proportions in the major salivary glands, especially the parotid. The tumor is typically lobulated and enclosed within a connective tissue pseudocapsule that varies in thickness within the major salivary glands, whereas in mi- nor glands, the capsule is poorly defined to absent. Where the capsule is deficient, neoplastic tissue may lie in direct contact with, or may extend into, adjacent salivary tissue and may contribute to recurrences if treatment is excessively conservative (see following text).
Histopathology
Microscopically, mixed tumors demonstrate a wide spec- trum of histologic features (Figures 8-19 to 8-22). The pleomorphic patterns and the variable ratios of ductal to myoepithelial cells are also called pleomorphic adenoma. Approximately one third of mixed tumors show an almost

equal ratio of epithelial and mesenchymal elements (be- lieved to be derived from myoepithelial-differentiated cells). The epithelial component may appear as ducts, tubules, ribbons, and solid sheets, and the mesenchymal component may appear as myxoid, hyalinized connective tissue. Infrequently, fat, cartilage, and/or bone may be seen. Myoepithelial cells may appear as plasmacytoid cells or spindled cells with an immunoprofile showing coexpression of cytokeratin markers, variable positivity for S-100 protein, calponin, p63, and alpha-smooth muscle actin. The plasmacytoid cells, when seen, are highly characteristic of mixed tumors and are almost never found in other salivary gland tumors. The ductal cell components are positive for several cytokeratins, in- cluding 3, 6, 10, 11, 13, and 16. Most importantly for diagnosis mixed tumors are positive for keratin 7 but negative for keratin 20.
A capsule of varying thickness surrounds mesenchymal and stromal components. This pseudocapsule may demon- strate islands of tissue within it or extending through it that represent outgrowths or pseudopods continuous with the main tumor mass, and likely contribute to recurrences, particularly in the parotid gland.
• Figure 8-21 Mixed tumor with cartilage (upper left) and bone (dark blue) differentiation.
• Figure 8-22 Mixed tumor showing plasmacytoid myoepithelial cells.
Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment of choice is surgical excision. Enucleation of mixed tumors within the parotid gland is not recom- mended because of the risk of recurrence due to extension of tumor through capsular defects. In limited series, good control rates have been described for mixed tumors in the parotid gland when enucleation is combined with radiation therapy. Removal of mixed tumors arising within the pa- rotid gland is complicated by the presence of the facial nerve. Any surgical approach, therefore, must include pre- servation of the uninvolved facial nerve. In most cases, su- perficial parotidectomy (lateral lobectomy) with preserva- tion of the facial nerve is the most appropriate management for those tumors arising within the parotid. Resection of the submandibular gland is the preferred treatment for mixed tumors in this location. Lesions of the palate or gingiva often involve or abut periosteum or bone, making complete removal difficult, unless some bone is removed. Other oral benign mixed tumors can be more easily excised, preferably including tissue beyond the pseudocapsule.
Inadequate initial removal of mixed tumors in major glands may result in recurrence, often with multiple, discrete tumor foci. Rates of recurrence within the parotid gland are
CHAPTER 8 Salivary Gland Diseases

204 CHAPTER 8
Salivary Gland Diseases
3.4% at 5 years and 6.8% after 10 years, with a wide range reported. These recurrent lesions may be distributed widely within the area of previous surgery and may occur in asso- ciation with the surgical scar. In most instances, the recur- rent tumor maintains the original pathology; however, with each recurrence, the possibility of malignant transformation (carcinoma ex-mixed tumor) is increased. The proportion of mixed tumors undergoing malignant transformation is not known with certainty, because almost all tumors are treated fairly early in their clinical course. However, anecdotal evi- dence suggests that if lesions are untreated for an extended length of time, typically years to decades, a proportion may undergo malignant transformation. The probability of ma- lignant change also increases if the area has been treated previously with surgery or radiotherapy.
Basal Cell Adenoma
Basal cell adenoma, as originally defined, represents a group of benign salivary neoplasms of histologic uniformity. Use of this term as a specific diagnostic entity has given way to subdivisions of individual benign salivary gland neoplasms that are composed of isomorphic epithelial cell populations that lack the histologic diversity that characterize mixed tumors. The classification scheme is based on the histologic pattern (see Box 8-13).
Basal cell adenomas constitute approximately 1% to 2% of all salivary gland adenomas. About 70% are found within the parotid followed by the submandibular gland. In minor salivary glands, most occur in the upper lip, followed in frequency by adenomas in the palate, buccal mucosa, and lower lip.
Clinical Features
Basal cell adenomas are generally slow growing, solitary, painless masses that tend to be clinically distinct and firm on palpation, but can be multifocal and multinodular. The age range of patients is between 35 and 80 years, with a mean age of approximately 60 years. A distinct male predi- lection has been noted.
Histopathology
Based on overall architectural features, basal cell adeno- mas may be separated into four subsets: solid, trabecular, tubular, and membranous forms. In the solid variety of basal cell adenoma, islands or sheets of isomorphic basa- loid cells often show peripheral palisading, with individual cells at the periphery appearing cuboidal to low columnar in profile (Figure 8-23). The trabecular form of basal cell adenoma exhibits thin trabeculae and cords of epithelial cells separated by a delicately vascularized stroma. The tubular form shows ductal structures as the dominant feature with lining cells of cuboidal type surrounded by single or multiple layers of basaloid cells (Figures 8-24 and 8-25). Membranous adenoma grows in a nodular fashion with variably sized islands of tumor tissue sur- rounded by a thick periodic acid–Schiff (PAS)-positive hyaline membrane. Similar, if not identical, eosinophilic

• Figure 8-25 Basal cell adenoma, trabecular pattern.
hyaline material is noted in droplet form within the inter- cellular areas of the tumor islands, similar to those noted in collagenous spherulosis of the breast and polycystic adenosis of salivary glands. Membranous adenomas may also contain foci of normal salivary gland, giving the er- roneous impression of invasiveness and necessitating sep- aration from adenoid cystic carcinoma.
The membranous (basal cell) adenoma (dermal analog tumor) variant occurs predominantly in the parotid

gland (.90% of cases), with few cases occurring in the other major glands. These lesions range from 1 to 5 cm in greatest dimension and generally present as an asymp- tomatic swelling. Several patients with this particular finding in the parotid gland have presented with syn- chronous or metachronous adnexal cutaneous tumors, including dermal cylindroma, trichoepithelioma, and eccrine spiradenoma.
Treatment and Prognosis
Except for membranous adenoma, basal cell adenomas are benign and rarely recur. The membranous form of basal cell adenoma has a significant rate of recurrence because of its growth pattern and multifocal nature. Preferred manage- ment consists of conservative surgical excision, including a margin of normal uninvolved tissue.
Canalicular Adenoma
Canalicular adenoma is generally separated from other basal cell adenomas because it occurs almost exclusively within the oral cavity, where it accounts for up to 6% of all minor salivary gland neoplasms. This benign neoplasm occurs most commonly in the upper lip and has distinctive histo- logic features. Its biological behavior is, however, similar to that of the general group of basal cell adenomas.
Clinical Features
A narrow age range is noted in patients with canalicular adenomas. Most patients tend to be older than 50 years of age, and most patients are women. The upper lip is by far the most common site for canalicular adenomas, with one series reporting 81% of lesions located in this region. Lesions tend to be freely movable and asymptomatic and range in size from a few millimeters to 2 to 3 cm.
Histopathology
Characteristically, canalicular adenomas show bilayered strands of basaloid cells that branch and anastomose within a delicate stroma that is highly vascular and contains few fibroblasts and little collagen (Figures 8-26 and 8-27). Indi- vidual cells are characteristically cuboidal to columnar, with
• Figure 8-26 Canalicular adenoma with multiple foci.
moderate to abundant amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm. Canalicular adenomas occasionally may not be totally encapsulated, and more than 20% of cases are multifocal.
Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment of choice for canalicular adenoma is surgical excision with the inclusion of a cuff of clinically normal tissue. The fact that more than 20% of lesions are multi- focal may account for some recurrences.
Myoepithelioma
Benign salivary gland tumors composed entirely of myo- epithelial cells are called myoepitheliomas (Figure 8-28). Although these tumors are of epithelial origin, the pheno- typic expression of the tumor cells is more closely related to that of smooth muscle. Reflective of this is the immunohis- tochemical staining of myoepithelioma cells with antibodies to p63, actins, cytokeratin, and S-100 protein.
Most myoepitheliomas arise within the parotid gland, followed by the intraoral minor salivary glands and, less commonly, the submandibular gland. Clinically, myoepi- theliomas present as circumscribed painless masses. Lesions appear from the third through ninth decades (median age, 53 years) and in both genders equally.
Microscopically, the tumor may be composed of plas- macytoid cells or spindle cells in varying proportions.

  • Figure 8-28 Myoepithelioma composed of plasmacytoid myoepi- thelial cells.
Approximately 70% of cases contain spindle cells, and ap- proximately 20% are composed of plasmacytoid cells. Oc- casionally, both cell forms may be seen in approximately equal quantity. Rarely do clear cells dominate the histo- logic presentation, leading to the designation of a clear cell variant of this entity.
Treatment of this benign lesion is identical to that of the benign mixed tumor. Conservative excision of lesions aris- ing in minor salivary glands is advised, including a thin rim of surrounding normal tissue. When lesions are noted within the parotid gland, superficial parotidectomy is indi- cated. The overall prognosis is excellent, and recurrences are not expected.
Oncocytic Tumors
Oncocytoma
Oncocytoma, or oxyphilic adenoma, is a rare lesion seen predominantly in the parotid gland (Figures 8-29 to 8-31). This lesion is composed of oncocytes, which are large granu- lar acidophilic cells filled with mitochondria. Oncocytes are normally found in the intralobular ducts of salivary glands and usually increase in number with age. The histogenetic

source of this lesion is believed to be the salivary duct epithe- lium, in particular the striated duct.
Clinically, oncocytomas are solid, ovoid encapsulated lesions, usually smaller than 5 cm in diameter when they are noted within the major salivary glands. In some instances, bilateral occurrence may be noted. These lesions are rarely seen intraorally.
Within individual glands (most often the parotid), a non-neoplastic and multicentric cellular change known as oncocytosis may be seen. This metaplasia of salivary duct and acinar cells is seen in the context of an otherwise normal gland. As oncocytic foci enlarge, confusion with oncocytoma may occur.
Microscopically, oncocytoma cells are polyhedral with granular eosinophilic cytoplasm. Nuclei are centrally placed and are typically vesicular. The histologic pattern usually consists of sheets of cells, although microcystic spaces and clear cell changes may be seen. The histochemical stain phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin (PTAH), highlighting the intracytoplasmic mitochondria, is useful to confirm the diagnosis of oncocytoma. Antimitochondrial antibodies may also be used in an immunohistochemical approach to confirm the diagnosis.

The growth rate is slow, and the course is benign. Treat- ment is conservative, with superficial parotidectomy as the treatment of choice for parotid lesions. In minor salivary glands, removal of the tumor with a margin of normal tissue is deemed adequate. Recurrence is rarely noted.
The malignant oncocytic tumor, or malignant oncocy- toma, is rare. The diagnosis is based on atypical nuclear changes in oncocytes in conjunction with an invasive pat- tern. Malignant change may arise de novo, or it may occur in a preexisting benign oncocytoma.
Papillary Cystadenoma Lymphomatosum
(Warthin’s Tumor)
Papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum, also known as Warthin’s tumor, accounts for approximately 7% of epithe- lial neoplasms of salivary glands, with the vast majority oc- curring within the parotid gland (Figures 8-32 to 8-34).
• Figure 8-32 Papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum (Warthin’s tumor) in the tail of the parotid gland.
• Figure 8-33 Warthin’s tumor composed of pink oncocytes and lymphoid tissue.
• Figure 8-34 Warthin’s tumor. Electron micrograph showing oncocytes in tumor cells. Note abundant mitochondria and nucleus (upper left).
Intraorally, this lesion is rare. It is seen predominantly in men, typically between the fifth and eighth decades of life with a strong positive association between the development of Warthin’s tumor and cigarette smoking. As such some have proposed that the lesion represents a form of hypersen- sitivity reaction to components of cigarettes.
Warthin’s tumor is thought to arise within lymph nodes as a result of entrapment of salivary gland elements early in development. This theory is supported by the occasional case of multicentricity, as well as by normal lymph node architecture surrounding many early or developing tumors. This is the most common salivary gland tumor to occur bilaterally, and it is the most common salivary tumor to be synchronously associated with other salivary tumors. It is believed that some intraoral lesions may arise in an area of reactive lymphoid hyperplasia as a result of chronic inflam- mation.
When it occurs in the parotid, this tumor presents typi- cally as a doughy to cystic mass in the inferior pole of the gland, adjacent and posterior to the angle of the mandible. In this situation, the proximity of the submandibular gland may give the impression that the lesion has developed within this gland, rather than within the parotid.
The tumor is encapsulated and has a smooth to lobulated surface and a round outline. Microscopically, numerous cystic spaces of irregular outline contain papillary projec- tions lined by columnar eosinophilic cells (oncocytes). The lining cells are supported by cuboidal cells that overlie lymphoid tissue with germinal centers.
Recurrences have been reported but are believed to rep- resent second primary lesions. Malignant transformation to carcinoma, especially as a complication of radiotherapy to the region, is rare.
Sebaceous Adenoma
The presence of sebaceous glands or evidence of seba- ceous differentiation has been noted in submandibular and parotid salivary glands. This particular tissue, thought to originate in intralobular ducts, gives rise to sebaceous

Salivary Gland Diseases
adenoma and to other sebaceous neoplasms designated as sebaceous lymphadenoma, sebaceous carcinoma, and se- baceous lymphadenocarcinoma. These rare lesions (,0.5% of all salivary gland adenomas) are composed predominantly of sebaceous gland–derived cells; they are well differentiated when benign, and moderately to poorly differentiated when malignant. The use of an anti- body to adipophilin, a protein on the surface of intracel- lular lipid droplets, is useful to identify sebocytes and sebaceous lesions. In sebaceous lymphadenoma, a benign lymphoid component is seen. The parotid gland is the site of chief involvement; lesions occur at this location 50% of the time, although intraoral lesions have been re- ported, chiefly in the buccal mucosa and retromolar region. Parotidectomy is the treatment of choice when lesions arise in this gland. Surgical excision is used in cases of intraoral neoplasms.
Ductal Papilloma
Ductal papillomas comprise sialadenoma papilliferum, in- verted ductal papilloma, and intraductal papilloma. These rare tumors are thought to arise within the interlobular and excretory duct portions of the salivary gland unit.
Sialadenoma papilliferum is an unusual benign salivary gland neoplasm that was first reported in 1969 as a distinct entity of minor and major salivary gland origin. Most cases reported subsequently have been found intraorally; the buc- cal mucosa and the palate are the most common sites. Sial- adenoma papilliferum usually presents as a painless exo- phytic papillary lesion of the surface mucosa and salivary duct epithelium. Most cases have been reported in men between the fifth and eighth decades of life. The clinical impression before removal is that of a simple papilloma, owing to its frequent keratotic appearance and papillary surface configuration.
This tumor appears to originate from the superficial por- tion of the salivary gland excretory duct (Figure 8-35). Papil- lary processes develop, forming convoluted clefts and spaces. Each papillary projection is lined by a layer of epithelium approximately two to three cells thick, and is supported by a
core of fibrovascular connective tissue. The more superficial portions of the lesion demonstrate a squamous epithelial lining; deeper portions show more cuboidal to columnar cells, often oncocytic in appearance. As growth continues, the overlying mucous membrane becomes papillary to ver- rucous in nature, much like a squamous papilloma. This le- sion generally resembles syringocystadenoma papilliferum of the scalp, a lesion of eccrine sweat gland origin.
The behavior of this lesion is benign. Management consists of conservative surgery; there is little chance of recurrence.
A related papillary lesion of minor salivary gland duct origin is the inverted ductal papilloma. This rare entity presents as a nodular submucosal mass resembling a fibroma or lipoma. It is seen in adults and has an equal gender distribution.
Microscopically, marked proliferation of ductal epithe- lium is seen subjacent to intact mucosa (Figure 8-36). Crypts and cyst-like spaces lined by columnar cells with polarized nuclei are interspersed with goblet cells and transi- tional forms of cuboidal to squamous cells as an intralumi- nal proliferative process with an endophytic growth pattern.
The third form of ductal papilloma is intraductal papilloma. This rare lesion arises from a greater depth within the ductal system, often presenting as a salivary obstruction caused by intraluminal exophytic growth. Histologically, a single or double layer of cuboidal to columnar epithelium covers several papillary fronds that project into a duct, with no evidence of proliferation into the wall of the cyst (Figure 8-37). Treatment for this lesion, as well as for inverted ductal papilloma, is simple excision. There is little risk of recurrence.
Malignant Neoplasms
Salivary gland malignancies can be classified in several ways. Box 8-15 lists them according to relative frequency, and Box 8-16 lists them according to biological behavior. Box 8-17 provides a summary of the general features that characterize malignancies of minor salivary glands. Table 8-2 compares features of benign and malignant salivary gland tumors.

Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma
Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is the most common salivary gland malignancy and exhibits biological behaviors that range from relatively indolent (low grade) to clinically ag- gressive (high grade). All are capable of metastasis, but low- grade mucoepidermoid carcinomas typically pursue a lo- cally invasive, relatively nonaggressive course. As the name implies, mucoepidermoid carcinomas are epithelial mucin- producing tumors. They are believed to arise from reserve cells in the interlobular and intralobular segments of the salivary duct system. Neoplastic mucous cells contain

neutral glycoproteins, acidic mucins, and sulfomucins; epi- dermoid cells contain keratin intermediate filaments.
Clinical Features
The most common site is the parotid gland, where 60% to 90% of mucoepidermoid carcinomas are encountered (Box 8-18). This lesion represents the most common malig- nant tumor of salivary glands and is the most common salivary gland malignancy of childhood. Mucoepidermoid carcinomas account for approximately 34% of parotid ma- lignancies, 20% of submandibular gland malignancies, and

The prevalence of mucoepidermoid carcinoma is highest in the third through fifth decades of life, and an equal gen- der representation has been noted. The annual incidence is 0.44 cases per 100,000 persons. Clinical manifestations of this lesion depend greatly on the grade of malignancy (Figure 8-38).

cavity, mucoepidermoid carcinoma often resembles an ex- travasation or retention-type mucocele that at times may be fluctuant as a result of mucous cyst formation. Tumors of high-grade malignancy, on the other hand, grow rapidly and are often accompanied by pain and mucosal ulceration. Within the major salivary glands, high-grade tumors may present with evidence of facial nerve involvement or ob- structive signs. Central or intraosseous mucoepidermoid carcinomas can also arise within the mandible or maxilla, appearing as radiolucent lesions within the molar and premolar areas.

Histopathology
Mucoepidermoid carcinomas typically appear as a lobular infiltration of adjacent tissue, although they are often well circumscribed. A wide range of cell type predominance, dif- ferentiation, and composition characterizes this neoplasm. Lesions generally are divided into low-, intermediate-, and high-grade types (Table 8-3). Low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinomas are composed of cuboidal to columnar mucus- secreting cells arranged around microcystic structures, with an intermingling of epithelial, or “intermediate,” cells with a few epidermoid cells (Figures 8-39 and 8-40). The mucin-con- taining cells are PAS and mucicarmine positive. Coalescence of small cysts into large cystic spaces is typical of low-grade malignancy. These cysts may distend the surrounding sup- portive tissue and rupture, allowing escape of mucus into surrounding tissues, with a concomitant reactive inflamma- tory response. At the margin of low-grade tumors, the pattern is often one of broad “pushing” fronts.
High-grade malignancies are characterized by neoplastic cell clusters composed chiefly of epidermoid cells that are

• Figure 8-40 Mucoepidermoid carcinoma, low grade. Note cystic spaces and mucous tumor cells.
more solid, with fewer mucin-containing cystic spaces and scattered mucous cells (Figures 8-41 and 8-42). Larger num- bers of non–mucin-producing epithelial cells are seen at the expense of better-differentiated mucous cells. Cellular pleo- morphism, nuclear hyperchromatism, and mitotic figures are noted within these higher-grade tumors. In many high- grade mucoepidermoid carcinomas, much of the lesion may resemble squamous cell carcinoma, with only small numbers of mucous cells evident. In high-grade lesions, infiltration in the form of cords and strands of cells may be noted well beyond the obvious clinical focus of the tumor.
Intermediate-grade lesions lie histologically and biologi- cally between low- and high-grade lesions. Mucous cells and microcystic spaces are apparent but are not as numerous as in low-grade lesions.
There are several proposed microscopic grading systems, but the WHO schema patterned after one proposed by the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) is the most commonly used. This schema employs a point system for five microscopic features to arrive at a score that is then translated into one of three grades (low, intermediate and high grade). These features are cystic component, mitoses, perineural invasion, necrosis, and anaplasia.

A specific cytogenetic abnormality has been described in mucoepidermoid carcinomas, t(11;19)(q14-21;p12-13) that results in a MECT1-MAML2 fusion gene product. The presence of this translocation is associated with a rela- tively better prognosis irrespective of histologic grade.
Prognosis and Treatment
Prognostic significance may be generally correlated to histo- logic grades of malignancy. Low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinomas characteristically follow a benign clinical course; however, in some instances, low-grade lesions have metasta- sized widely. Clinical confirmation of the aggressiveness of high-grade carcinomas is generally evident within the first 5 years after the initial treatment; local and distant metasta- ses are evident in as many as 60% of cases. The incidence of metastasis to cervical lymph nodes from mucoepidermoid carcinomas of the parotid gland (excluding low-grade le- sions) has reached 44%. A 5-year survival rate of 95% or greater is associated with low-grade lesions. For high-grade lesions, however, survival rates are approximately 40%. In follow-up periods extending to 15 years, the cure rate for high-grade carcinoma drops to 25% or less.
The prognosis of intraoral minor salivary gland muco- epidermoid carcinomas has been shown to be related to the immunohistochemical demonstration of a universal cyclin- dependent kinase inhibitor, where low expression was re- lated to overall poorer prognosis, whereas expression of the proliferative marker Ki-67 was correlated with those histo- logic factors that indicated a generally poorer prognosis, as does beta-catenin expression.
Treatment of low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinomas is typically surgical. High-grade malignancies are usually managed with surgery plus postoperative radiotherapy to
the primary site. Neck dissection is rarely performed in small lesions of low-grade malignancy; high-grade tumors usually require this form of management.
Central (intraosseous) mucoepidermoid carcinomas are usually of low-grade histology and behavior. Most deaths occur because of uncontrolled local recurrence. When aris- ing centrally in bone, these lesions have been associated with a 40% recurrence rate after simple curettage.
Polymorphous Low-Grade Adenocarcinoma
Polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma was first reported in 1983 by two different groups using the terms lobular carcinoma of salivary glands and terminal duct carcinoma. Today, the term polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma is the accepted term for this entity. It has been segregated from other salivary tumors, particularly the adenoid cystic carcinoma, because of its distinct clinical, histomorpho- logic, and behavioral aspects. This tumor is generally con- sidered to be a low-grade malignancy with a relatively indo- lent course and lower risk of recurrence and metastasis compared with adenoid cystic carcinoma. The putative source of the polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma is believed to be reserve cells in the most proximal portion of the salivary duct. Myoepithelial-differentiated cells appear in this neoplasm, but only in low to moderate numbers.
Clinical Features
This neoplasm occurs in the fifth through eighth decades of life with no gender predilection. It accounts for 26% of all salivary carcinomas; more than 70% occur in patients be- tween the ages of 50 and 70 with a mean age of 59 years, and it appears almost exclusively in minor salivary glands, the palate being the most frequently reported site (Boxes 8-19 and 8-20). Polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinomas typi- cally present as firm, elevated, nonulcerated nodular swell- ings that are usually nontender. A wide range in size has been noted, but most are between 1 and 4 cm in diameter. The slow growth rate is evidenced by the long duration, months to years, before diagnosis and treatment. Neurologic symp- toms usually are not reported in association with this tumor.

Histopathology
Absence of encapsulation together with infiltrating streams of cells and a general lobular morphology characterize this group of low-grade adenocarcinomas. Infiltration into the surrounding salivary gland and connective tissue is evident at low-power examination. In cases involving the hard pal- ate or jaw-bone, extension into surrounding or adjacent bone may be noted. A wide range of histomorphologic pat- terns between and within individual tumors is characteris- tic. In most areas, the tumor is composed of a homogeneous population of cells with prominent, bland, uniform, and often-vesicular nuclei surrounded by minimal cytoplasm (Figures 8-43 to 8-48). These cells are arranged in lobules, as well as in solid nests. Tubules lined by a single layer of cells are typical of this tumor. Cribriform structures bearing a resemblance to adenoid cystic carcinoma may also be seen. Tumor cells, often spindled, are also arranged in

contain areas of mucoid quality and hyalinization. A help- ful diagnostic finding is that polymorphous low-grade ade- nocarcinoma consistently shows a p631/p402 immuno- phenotype in contrast to both adenoid cystic carcinoma and cellular pleomorphic adenoma that shows a concordant p631/p401 (most common) or p632/p402 profile.
Treatment and Prognosis
The tumor is managed by surgical excision. With wide sur- gical excision, the recurrence rate is approximately 10%, and the overall survival rate is excellent. In patients who present with concurrent regional lymph node enlargement, neck dissection should be performed. The role of radiation therapy in the primary treatment of polymorphous low- grade adenocarcinoma has yet to be fully assessed in the absence of regional nodal spread.
A recently described low-grade adenocarcinoma with structural similarity to the polymorphous low-grade adeno- carcinoma, the cribriform adenocarcinoma, has caused some confusion from a diagnostic and treatment perspec- tive. This rare entity currently demonstrates minor salivary gland exclusivity, most often arising in the base of the tongue, with an unlimited growth potential, a low prolif- erative index and other characteristics common to typical low-grade polymorphous adenocarcinoma. Important how- ever, is the frequent presentation of metastasis to regional cervical lymph nodes with this entity compared with low- grade polymorphous adenocarcinomas.
Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma
Adenoid cystic carcinoma is a high-grade malignancy that has a fair 5-year survival rate but a dismal 15-year survival rate. It is composed of duct-type epithelial cells and myoepithelial cells in variable patterns. Typically showing little cellular atypia and only rare mitotic figures, it pursues an unrelenting course that defies most therapeutic measures.
Clinical Features
This lesion accounts for approximately 23% of all salivary gland carcinomas (Box 8-21). Approximately 50% to 70% of all reported cases of adenoid cystic carcinoma occur in minor salivary glands of the head and neck, chiefly of the palate. In the major salivary glands, the parotid gland is most often affected. Most patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma are in the fifth through seventh decades of life, and no gender predilection has been noted.
In the major salivary glands, the clinical appearance of a typically behaving adenoid cystic carcinoma is usually that of an infiltrative, slow-growing unilobular mass that is firm on palpation, although with occasional pain or tenderness. These lesions are generally characterized by a slow growth rate; they are often present for several years before the patient seeks treatment. Pain, facial nerve

weakness, or paralysis may occasionally be the initial pre- senting symptom, especially in late-stage lesions.
Bone invasion occurs often, initially without radio- graphic changes, because of infiltration through marrow spaces. Distant spread to the lungs is more common than metastasis to regional lymph nodes. The lesion typically invades perineural spaces, leading to extension of neoplasm well beyond the primary mass. A common feature of intra- oral lesions, particularly those arising on the palate, is ulcer- ation of the overlying mucosa, a point often used to help distinguish this lesion clinically from the more common benign mixed tumor (Figure 8-49).
Histopathology
Three basic histomorphologic patterns have been identi- fied: tubular, cribriform, and solid (Figures 8-50 to 8-56). The cribriform pattern is the best-recognized pattern and the prototypical one that typifies the tumor. The pseudo- cystic spaces contain sulfated mucopolysaccharides that are ultrastructurally characterized by multilayered or repli- cated basal lamina material. The tubular form is composed of smaller islands of cells with distinct duct-like structures centrally. The solid basaloid pattern shows little duct for- mation and is composed of larger islands of small to me- dium-sized cells with small, dark nuclei. This type may show more pleomorphism than the others and is associated

with a poorer outcome. Areas of central necrosis within solid clusters of cells may indicate a more aggressive form of disease. Factors regarding prediction of behavior include the size of the histologic type, whether it is a primary le- sion, the anatomic location, the presence or absence of metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, and facial nerve involvement. An aggressive variant, the dedifferentiated

form of adenoid cystic carcinoma, arises within a preexist- ing or typical adenoid cystic carcinoma, most likely in re- current or metastatic disease. In this variant, the growth rate or progression is rapid.
Ductal structures are lined by cuboidal cells with uni- form nuclei and condensed chromatin. An outer layer of cells with clear cytoplasm and angular nuclei characteristi- cally surrounds the inner layer of cuboidal cells. The outer layer of cells exhibits myoepithelial differentiation and
stains positive for actins. Nuclear atypia is absent or mini- mal, and mitotic figures are rare.
Treatment and Prognosis
Regardless of the site of the primary lesion, surgery is re- garded as the treatment of choice for adenoid cystic carci- nomas. When the parotid glands are involved, wide resec- tion in the form of a superficial parotidectomy or superficial and deep lobectomy is recommended, depending on size and tumor location. In the parotid region, the debate is whether the facial nerve should be spared; most investiga- tors recommend resection if the tumor surrounds or in- vades this nerve.
Intraorally, wide excision, often with removal of underly- ing bone, is the treatment of choice. Radical surgical exci- sion may be justified to obtain surgical margins that are free of tumor.
Radiation therapy has a role in the management of pri- mary disease, as a postoperative modality, and in locally recurrent disease, but to be effective, the radiation fields must be wide, reflecting the disseminated nature of the disease. Chemotherapy is generally regarded as ineffective, although multiple-agent chemotherapy has shown some promise in the management of widely metastatic disease. Immunohistochemical demonstration of c-kit (CD117) protein expression by this tumor provided a biological ra- tionale for the addition of monoclonal antibody therapy (imatinib or Gleevac, for example), but correlation between response and protein levels has proven disappointingly weak.
The prognosis for patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma must be judged not in terms of 5-year survival rates, but rather, in terms of 15- to 20-year survival rates. Survival rates at 5 years approximate 70%; at 15 years, the rate is only 10%. Factors that negatively influence the prognosis include the presence of tumor at the line of surgical exci- sion, tumor size greater than 4 cm, the presence of more than 30% of a solid pattern within the tumor, and the pres- ence of facial nerve paralysis at initial presentation. A long survival time has been positively correlated with a greater number of gland like spaces per square millimeter (tubular and cribriform patterns within the tumor). Between 80% and 90% of patients die of disease by the 15th year, with local recurrence rates ranging from 16% to 85%, as stated in several series. The lung is the most common site of dis- tant metastasis, followed by bone, brain, and liver.
Clear Cell Carcinoma
Four salivary gland tumors, when poorly fixed, may have areas in which tumor cells exhibit clear cytoplasm, appar- ently as a result of autolysis of cytoplasmic organelles (Box 8-22). This categorization is descriptive of more than a single entity. Also, two clear cell tumors, clear cell carci- noma and epimyoepithelial carcinoma (discussed later), exhibit clear cell changes that are the result of cytoplasmic accumulation of glycogen and myofilaments, respectively. Clear cell carcinoma, also called hyalinizing clear cell

Microscopically, the neoplasm is composed of uniform bland cells, predominantly with clear cytoplasm (Figures 8-58 and 8-59). The pattern is typically trabecular, although nests and sheets of cells may be seen. The tumor cells stain positive for glycogen, but negative for mucin, S-100 protein, and muscle-specific actin. Hyaliniz- ing clear cell carcinoma demonstrates a consistent EWSR1- ATF1 fusion, a similar translocation that is seen in clear cell odontogenic carcinoma (CCOC) but not found in other clear cell mimics. Treatment is by excision, and recurrence is very uncommon.

Acinic Cell Carcinoma
Acinic cell carcinoma occurs predominantly in the major salivary glands, especially the parotid. The putative source of acinic cell carcinoma is the intercalated duct reserve cell, although there is reason to believe that the acinic cell itself retains the potential for neoplastic transformation.
Clinical Features
Acinic cell carcinoma is found in all age groups, including children, with the peak incidence noted within the fifth and sixth decades of life. No gender predilection has been noted.

 • Figure 8-59 Clear cell carcinoma showing perineural invasion.
This lesion accounts for 14% of all parotid gland tumors and 9% of the total of salivary gland carcinomas of all sites. An unusual feature is the frequency of bilateral parotid gland involvement in approximately 3% of cases. Most cases (approximately 80%) develop within the superficial
lobe and the inferior pole of the parotid gland. Fewer cases have been reported within the submandibular gland (4%) and the intraoral minor salivary glands (17%). Within the oral cavity, most cases occur in the palate and the buccal mucosa. Acinic cell carcinoma usually presents as a slow- growing lesion smaller than 3 cm in diameter. Although it is not indicative of the prognosis, pain is a common pre- senting symptom. Rarely, acinic cell carcinoma, as with other malignant salivary gland tumors, including adenoid cystic carcinoma, may assume a dedifferentiated phenotype (Figure 8-60), with corresponding levels of clinical aggres- siveness, rapid growth, lymphovascular invasion, and regional lymph node metastasis.
Histopathology
Acinic cell carcinoma typically grows as an intraglandular mass that is generally well circumscribed. The neoplasm usually exhibits a solid microscopic pattern, although one third of lesions have a microcystic pattern (Figures 8-61 to 8-64). Papillary and follicular patterns may be seen within the solid component, or may represent the majority of

the lesion. Hemosiderin is often found, and there is little stromal tissue. Tumor cells are uniform and well differenti- ated toward serous acinar cells, containing cytoplasmic PAS-positive, diastase digestion–resistant granules similar to those found in normal acinic cells. Many acinic cell car- cinomas demonstrate clear cell element zones, probably as a result of inadequate fixation.
Treatment and Prognosis
Surgery is the preferred treatment. In general, acinic cell carcinomas seldom metastasize, yet they have a tendency to recur. Determinant survival rates are 89% at 5 years and 56% at 20 years, indicating the overall malignant nature of these tumors. Metastases to regional lymph nodes occur in ap- proximately 10% of cases, whereas distant metastases occur in approximately 15% of cases. It has been found that neither the morphologic pattern nor the cell composition is a pre- dictable prognostic feature. Unfavorable prognostic features include pain or fixation to surrounding tissue; gross tumor invasion into adjacent tissue; and microscopic features of desmoplasia, cellular atypia, and increased mitotic activity.
Adenocarcinoma not Otherwise Specified
By definition, any malignancy arising from salivary duct epithelium or within salivary glands of epithelial origin is an

adenocarcinoma. The term adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified is used as a diagnosis when lesions cannot be clas- sified into existing categories. The “not otherwise specified (NOS)” label indicates that the microscopic appearance is nonspecific. Whether the lesion can be considered of high grade depends on the presence of cellular atypia and an invasive growth pattern.
Rare Tumors
Carcinoma Ex-Mixed Tumor/Malignant Mixed Tumor/Metastasizing Mixed Tumor
Carcinoma ex-mixed tumor represents an epithelial malig- nancy arising in a preexisting mixed tumor in which such remnants may be identified. When metastatic disease oc- curs, only the malignant component metastasizes. This is more common than the malignant mixed tumor, which has also been recognized. One type of the latter lesion is a ma- lignancy in which both epithelial and mesenchymal compo- nents are malignant, hence a carcinosarcoma designation could be used. In metastatic sites, both elements are pre- sent. Metastasizing mixed tumor is characterized by a histo- logically benign mixed tumor that for some reason metasta- sizes while still retaining its bland, benign histologic appearance.

Salivary Gland Diseases
   AB
Carcinoma ex-mixed tumor usually arises from an un- treated benign mixed tumor known to be present for several years, or from a benign mixed tumor that has had many recurrences over many years (Figure 8-65). Malignancy oc- curring within a previously benign tumor is heralded by rapid growth after an extremely long period of minimally perceptible increase.
Approximately 68% of carcinoma ex-mixed tumors and malignant mixed tumors are found in the parotid gland, and 18% are found in the intraoral minor salivary glands. The average age when malignancy becomes evident is 60 years, approximately 20 years beyond the age noted for benign mixed tumors. Suspicious signs of malignancy in- clude fixation of the mass to surrounding tissues, ulcer- ation, and regional lymphadenopathy. Treatment is almost exclusively surgical, and radical neck dissection is part of the initial treatment in patients with evidence of cervical lymph node involvement.
Local recurrence is a problem in nearly half of patients with primary parotid neoplasms and in nearly three fourths of patients with submandibular and minor salivary gland tumors. Approximately 10% of cases present with uncon- trollable lymphatic disease, and nearly one third of these
show metastasis to distant sites, usually lung and bone. Determinant cure rates at 5, 10, and 15 years after treat- ment in one study were 40%, 24%, and 19%, respectively; in another study, 30% of those monitored for 10 years were free of disease.
Epimyoepithelial Carcinoma
Epimyoepithelial carcinoma is a clear cell–containing ma- lignancy of salivary gland (predominantly the major glands) origin characterized with a biphasic morphology. It is seen in the seventh and eighth decades of life, and a 2:1 female predilection has been reported.
A lobular growth pattern is generally present that is composed of two cell types: abundant intercalated duct– like elements forming ducts surrounded by clear myoepi- thelial cells. Glycogen, actins, and S-100 protein are present in the bordering clear cells, supporting their myo- epithelial origin (Figure 8-66). More specific myoepithe- lial cell markers may be used, including p63 and smooth muscle actin.
Recurrences have most often been associated with lesions larger than 3 cm. Overall recurrence and metastasis rates suggest that this is a malignancy of intermediate grade.

Salivary Duct Carcinoma
Salivary duct carcinoma is a high-grade malignancy of the major salivary glands. It is characterized clinically by a dis- tinct predominance in the parotid gland (more than 80% of cases); the submandibular gland accounts for the remain- der of cases. Nearly 80% of cases have been recorded in men, and the overall peak incidence is in the seventh de- cade. The lesion arises as a firm, painless mass. A striking microscopic resemblance to ductal carcinoma originating in the breast is noted, with architectural features that include papillary cribriform and solid growth patterns, along with a desmoplastic stroma and central or comedo-type necrosis. Expression of androgen receptor (AR) is also a defining characteristic of salivary duct carcinoma. Nuclear atypia is noted, but few mitoses are seen. Most tumors have infiltra- tive margins, and neural invasion is evident in approxi- mately 50% of cases.
Surgical excision is the treatment of choice. Large series indicate that more than 50% of patients die of their disease within 5 months to 6 years after treatment. Pulmonary and osseous metastases are often noted.
Basal Cell Adenocarcinoma
Basal cell adenocarcinoma, a rare tumor of the major sali- vary glands, is considered to be the malignant counterpart of basal cell adenoma, with a histologic resemblance to ductal carcinoma of the breast. It appears microscopically very similar to basal cell adenoma, except that it exhibits an infiltrative growth pattern and has the ability to metasta- size. These tumors are composed of nests, cords, and solid zones of basaloid cells (Figure 8-67). Two cytologic types of cells are often seen: small, compact cells and larger, polygo- nal cells. The former may often be seen surrounding the latter, frequently in a palisade fashion. The feature that separates this tumor from basal cell adenoma is the finding of small nests of neoplasm in adjacent normal structures. Infiltration of nerves is also seen. Local recurrence and distant metastasis seem to be distinct potentials for basal cell adenocarcinoma. Nonetheless, this tumor is generally regarded as a low-grade, minimally invasive malignancy.
• Figure 8-67 Basal cell adenocarcinoma in nested pattern.
With adequate surgical treatment, patients should have a favorable outcome.
Mammary Analog Secretory Carcinoma (MASC)
A recently described malignancy primarily occurring in the parotid gland, the MASC is a rare tumor sharing some morphologic similarities with acinic cell carcinoma and several histologic, immunophenotypical and genetic fea- tures with secretory carcinoma of the breast. The tumors have a lobulated growth pattern composed of microcystic tumor and solid structures formed by cells that do not con- tain PAS-positive secretory zymogen granules. MASC tu- mor cells express S-100, mammaglobin, and MUC-4 pro- teins. There is a characteristic t(12;15)(p13;q25) balanced translocation that leads to the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion prod- uct, a genotype that is not seen in other salivary gland tumors. The clinical behavior of MASC ranges from slow growth and infrequent recurrence after surgical resection to aggressive tumors associated with widespread metastasis and death.
Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Squamous cell carcinoma arising within the salivary glands is a relatively rare event and seems to be limited to the ma- jor salivary glands. The submandibular gland is most com- monly involved, followed by the parotid. Obstructive sial- adenitis (more common in the submandibular gland) has been thought to be a predisposing condition. Most patients are in the seventh decade of life or beyond.
Squamous cell carcinomas of the parotid and subman- dibular glands are generally well to moderately well differ- entiated with no evidence of mucin production. Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma and high-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma are usually alternative diagnoses.
Local recurrence and regional lymph node metastasis are common events, and distant metastasis is unusual. Surgery is the treatment of choice. As with most other salivary gland malignancies, ultimate survival relates more to clinical stage than to histologic differentiation.

 Reactive Lesions
In this chapter, three primary groupings of lesions— reactive, developmental, and neoplastic—are considered. An important point in the discussion of lymphoid lesions involving the oral cavity and adjacent areas is that many lesions, especially those arising in lymph nodes, are capable of simulating malignancy.
Lymphoid Hyperplasia
It is sometimes difficult to distinguish reactive from neoplastic lymphoid proliferations, especially when they occur in unusual sites such as the peritonsillar area, pal- ate, buccal mucosa, lymph nodes, and salivary glands. Often, special testing using immunohistochemistry is needed to determine whether the infiltrate is reactive or neoplastic.
One of the normal sites of lymphoid tissue is the pos- terolateral portion of the tongue. Here it forms a part of Waldeyer’s ring, an anatomic collection of benign lym- phoid tissue in the pharynx that circumscribes the naso- pharynx and oropharynx in an annular configuration that includes the base of tongue and soft palate. Aggrega- tions of lymphoid tissue within this area are part of the foliate papillae, or lingual tonsil. They may be distin- guished from other lymphoid tissues by deep crypts lined by stratified squamous epithelium. These papillae occasionally become inflamed or irritated, with associated enlargement and tenderness. In such instances, patients may become symptomatic. On examination,
these areas are enlarged and somewhat lobular in outline, with an intact overlying mucosa and prominent superfi- cial vessels. In instances in which such lesions are removed for diagnostic purposes, the chief finding is reac- tive lymphoid hyperplasia. Within the enlarged germinal centers, mitoses and macrophages containing cellular debris may be seen. In addition to the foliate papillae, other zones where lymphoid tissue is found include the anterior floor of the mouth on either side of the lingual frenum, the anterior tonsillar pillar, and the posterior portion of the soft palate (Figures 9-1 and 9-2). Because lymphoid tissues are not always found in these areas, they are usually regarded as ectopic. The term oral tonsil also refers to this tissue.
Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (oral tonsil) has male predominance and is noted within the second and third decades of life. In one study, a mean age of 23 years was found. Lesions range from 1 to 15 mm in diameter and may persist for years.
The buccal or facial lymph node is often the site of a reactive hyperplastic process. This is characterized as a freely movable submucosal nodule in the buccal mucosa that is usually adjacent to the second premolar and first molar teeth and can often be palpated extraorally. The cause of the process is unknown, but it may be a reaction to irritation or localized trauma. Gingivitis or periapical pathology may occasionally stimulate or initiate enlargement of this par- ticular lymph node.
Management should be directed toward elimination of the cause of the problem if it can be identified, followed by simple observation.

• Figure 9-2 Hyperplastic lymphoid follicle with prominent macro- phages (light-staining cells).
Follicular lymphoid hyperplasia may be seen in the posterior portion of the hard palate and soft palate region. This reactive polyclonal proliferation of lympho- cytes is often difficult to separate from lymphoprolifera- tive disease of the palate, a condition that is likely a low-grade marginal zone B-cell lymphoma. Histologi- cally, follicular lymphoid hyperplasia of the palate is characterized by irregularly sized, well-demarcated germinal centers with a crisply defined rim or mantle of small, mature lymphocytes. Within the germinal centers, macrophages contain phagocytosed nuclear debris. Using immunohistochemical techniques, a mixture of kappa and lambda light chains (B lymphocytes) is seen, indicating a polyclonal population of cells. In addition, the mantle zones are composed of both mature and im- mature B cells, whereas the extramantle zones contain B and T lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, and eosinophils. Indefinite follow-up is prudent because of possible progression to lymphoma.
Epithelioid Hemangioma (Angiolymphoid Hyperplasia With Eosinophilia)
Epithelioid hemangioma has many synonyms but is most commonly also known as angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia (ALHE). It was first described in 1948 as a nodular subcutaneous benign disease in young men and later cases with the same clinical and histologic features were reported in the oral cavity. In addition to nodular aggregates of lymphocytes and eosinophils, regional lymphadenopathy and blood (peripheral) eosinophilia were noted. Similar findings were noted under the head- ings of Kimura’s disease, eosinophilic granuloma of soft tissue, and eosinophilic lymphofolliculosis. Because Kimura’s disease was originally described as having a dis- tinct male predilection without associated regional lymph- adenopathy, most now believe that the two conditions represent different entities. Histologically, some differ- ences have been described, adding to the tendency to split ALHE and Kimura’s disease into two entities.
Etiology
Because of vascular proliferation and an intensive inflam- matory infiltrate, a reactive etiology has been suggested. Increased serum immunoglobulin (Ig)E levels and deposi- tion of IgE within the lymphoid follicles further suggest a reactive immune cause. Also demonstrated has been the presence of anti-Candida albicans antibody within the lesions and improvement after hyposensitization to this allergen.
Clinical Features
ALHE is found predominantly in the head and neck area, accounting for approximately 85% of all cases. However, oral mucous membrane involvement is rare. The labial mu- cosa is the oral site most commonly affected. A wide age range from 7 to 79 years has been noted, with a mean age of 35 years. Lesions generally are solitary, with a mean size of 1.7 cm. Peripheral eosinophilia greater than 4% has been noted in 20% of cases in which peripheral blood counts have been studied. The clinical course is characterized by the presence of a painless mobile submucosal nodule that enlarges gradually. Multiple lesions have been reported in more than 40% of cases.
Histopathology
Lesions are circumscribed and are usually grossly separate from surrounding tissue. A nodular mass of hyperplastic lymphoid tissue with well-developed lymphoid follicles containing germinal centers may be seen. Proliferating cap- illaries with plump endothelial cells are found in a dense, patchy infiltrate of lymphocytes, with eosinophils and fewer numbers of macrophages noted. Toward the periphery, this infiltrate may extend into surrounding soft tissue. Arterial intimal proliferation and disruption of the internal elastic

lamina may be seen. Early lesions or those in an active growth phase may be dominated by a vascular element; older or quiescent lesions may contain a larger percentage of inflammatory cells.
Differential Diagnosis
When it involves the labial mucosa, the characteristic nodule of ALHE may be indistinguishable from a minor salivary gland neoplasm or a mucus retention cyst or mucocele. Other benign soft tissue neoplasms, such as lipoma and schwannoma, might be included in the differential diagnosis.
Because of the presence of eosinophils within tissue, a microscopic differential diagnosis should include Langerhans cell disease (eosinophilic granuloma), traumatic (eosino- philic) granuloma, possibly a drug reaction (hypersensitivity), or a parasitic infection.
Treatment
Excision is the treatment of choice, although other treatments have been recommended including cryo- therapy, pulsed dye laser therapy, interferon, or cyto- toxic agents. Intralesional steroid injections have also been used with variable results. Recurrences are occa- sionally noted. The presence of blood or peripheral eosinophilia has generally been reported with numer- ous or recurrent lesions.
Developmental Lesions
Lymphoepithelial Cyst
Lymphoepithelial cyst is an uncommon lesion that may be found in the mouth, major salivary glands, or neck and is thought to arise from an entrapment of epithelium within lymph nodes or lymphoid tissue during development. Subsequent epithelial proliferation results in a clinically evident mass.
Oral lymphoepithelial cysts (see also the discussion on ectopic lymphoid tissue in Chapter 3) present as asymp- tomatic mucosal elevations that are well defined and yellowish pink (Figure 9-3). The site most commonly affected is the floor of the mouth, where approximately 50% of cases are found. Ventral and posterolateral por- tions of the tongue constitute an additional 40% of cases; the balance is shared among the soft palate, the mucobuccal fold, and anterior facial pillars. A wide age range is noted, from adolescence to the seventh decade of life. The gender distribution is essentially equal. Except for the small central cystic space, these lesions are identi- cal to ectopic lymphoid aggregates. Lymphoepithelial cysts of the parotid glands are an uncommon complica- tion of HIV infection, usually in younger patients, where there is salivary gland infiltration by polyclonal CD8- positive lymphocytes.
• Figure 9-3 Lymphoepithelial cyst in lingual frenum.
Histopathology
The lymphoepithelial cyst is lined by stratified squamous epithelium that often is parakeratotic. Focal areas of pseudostratified columnar cells or mucous cells may be present. The epithelial lining is surrounded by a discrete, well-circumscribed lymphoid component, often with germi- nal center formation and a sharply defined zone of mantle lymphocytes. In addition, the cyst wall may contain variable proportions of lymphocytes, macrophages, and plasma cells, with occasional multinucleated giant T cells (Figure 9-4). Continuity of the cyst lining with the surface oral epithelium may be noted occasionally.
Differential Diagnosis
In the anterior floor of the mouth, a sialolith may have a similar clinical appearance. However, a history of pain and swelling of the associated salivary gland would be expected with a salivary duct stone. Developmental anomalies such as teratomas or dermoid cysts, benign mesenchymal neoplasms, and salivary gland tumors might also be considered in a differential diagnosis for a

floor-of-mouth soft tissue mass. When it involves the parotid gland, a lymphoepithelial cyst must be distin- guished from salivary lymphoma, Warthin’s tumor, and cystic neoplasm of salivary origin.
Treatment
Conservative excisional biopsy is generally used for defini- tive diagnosis, as well as for treatment. Recurrence is not expected.
Neoplasms
Lymphoma
Lymphomas are malignant neoplasms of component cells of lymphoid tissues. Broad division of the group into Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas is widely accepted. Hodgkin’s lymphoma is primarily a disease of lymph nodes characterized by the presence of large binucleated cells called Reed-Sternberg cells and a lymphoid stroma composed of large numbers of non- neoplastic cells. Hodgkin’s lymphoma is very rare in the oral cavity.
Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHLs) are a relatively com- mon group of neoplasms (more than 50,000 cases per year) that often occur in extranodal head and neck sites, especially in HIV-infected (AIDS) patients. NHLs are heterogeneous in their presentation with a spectrum of behaviors. Some cases are indolent but ultimately fatal; others are aggressive and are rapidly fatal if left un- treated. NHL can arise in lymph nodes (nodal) and ex- tranodal sites. Up to 40% of all NHLs arise at extranodal sites, with the most common site being the gastrointesti- nal tract. In the West, they most commonly occur in the stomach, but in the Middle East, the intestine is the most common location. The head and neck is the second
Modified WHO Classification of Lymphomas
most common site for extranodal NHL; most cases arise in Waldeyer’s ring.
Similar to lymphomas arising in lymph nodes, B-cell lymphomas are the most common phenotype in extra- nodal sites. A wide histologic and biological spectrum of B-cell lymphomas occur in the head and neck. Although most are diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, other types are seen in specific sites and populations of patients. These include Burkitt’s lymphoma occurring in the facial bones of young patients and T-cell and natural killer cell lym- phomas in the nasofacial region, producing the clinical condition termed midline granuloma. A large proportion of lymphomas arise within lymph nodes embedded in the salivary tissues. Lymphomas may also arise within salivary gland parenchyma and resemble those arising in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). This group of tumors, now known as extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas, is genotypically and phenotypi- cally unique and is characterized by a relatively long and indolent natural history.
Classification
The microscopic classification of NHL continues to evolve. At least eight classifications have been proposed over the past 30 years. The current and most widely ad- opted system is that from the World Health Organization (WHO) (Table 9-1), which is based on a prior system known as the Revised European American Lymphoma (REAL) scheme. This scheme divides lymphomas into T- and B-cell groups and includes a number of entities that arise at extranodal sites. This system focuses on distinct biological entities defined by a combination of clinical, morphologic, immunophenotypic, and genotypic fea- tures. It has been shown to be highly reproducible and clinically relevant. Moreover, because it is a list of entities, new lymphomas can be added when they are identified and characterized. Both the WHO and REAL classification

systems have been criticized for their heavy reliance on immunohistochemical phenotyping and their problematic application when clinical information is missing or lim- ited. Moreover, because both systems provide a list of enti- ties without biological groupings, learning the systems can be difficult.
Etiology
Little is known about the origin of NHL. Variations in incidence in different ethnic groups suggest a strong genetic predisposition. Immunodeficiency, whether ac- quired or congenital, is an important risk factor for the development of some lymphomas and may be related to a defective immune response to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), permitting clonal expansion of infected cells. Some lymphomas are clearly associated with specific chromosome translocations such as t(8;14), t(8;22), and t(2;8) in Burkitt’s lymphoma and t(11;14) in mantle cell lymphoma (Table 9-2). These specific chro- mosome translocations result in the dysregulation of oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, producing un- regulated cell proliferation. Why specific translocations occur is not known.
Staging
The importance of proper staging (determining the clinical extent of disease) for patients with lymphoma in the oral region cannot be overemphasized. Staging serves a number of important purposes, including determination of the type and intensity of therapy, the overall prognosis for the pa- tient, and potential complications associated with the dis- ease. The Ann Arbor method, although initially designed to stage Hodgkin’s lymphoma, is now widely used for NHL (Box 9-1). Patients are generally assigned a stage between I and IV depending on the site and extent of their tumor. In
addition, patients are classified as “A” (no symptoms) or “B” (constitutional symptoms).
The staging procedure often differs according to the type and site of lymphoma. Gastrointestinal assessment is per- formed for lymphomas of Waldeyer’s ring because these tumors are often accompanied by gastrointestinal involvement. Extranodal marginal zone lymphoma tends to remain localized for prolonged periods and has a relatively indolent clinical course, hence less extensive investigation is often required. As- sessment of the central nervous system (CNS) is performed for

   lymphomas of the nose and paranasal sinuses, and for lympho- blastic lymphoma and undifferentiated types. Bone marrow biopsy is generally performed for all extranodal lymphomas of the head and neck, but staging laparotomy is rarely done because visceral organ involvement is unlikely.
Clinical Features
Clinically, three broad groups of NHLs can be discerned on the basis of biological behavior (Table 9-3). These lympho- mas may be clinically indolent, aggressive, or highly aggres- sive. Indolent lymphomas are characterized by slow growth, wide dissemination at presentation, a long natural history, and relative incurability. By contrast, aggressive and highly aggressive groups are characterized by rapid growth, fre- quent localized presentation, a short natural history, and frequent responsiveness to chemotherapeutic agents. Para- doxically, the most aggressive lymphomas are the ones most likely to be cured. Most lymphomas in adults are diffuse B-cell lymphoma or follicular lymphomas, which together make up more than 50% of all types. Follicular lymphoma is predominantly a tumor of lymph nodes and rarely occurs in the oral cavity. By contrast, T-cell lymphomas are consid- erably less common at all sites, including the oral cavity. In children, aggressive and highly aggressive lymphomas are the most common, with Burkitt’s lymphoma accounting for more than 40% of types.
The clinical presentation of lymphomas of the oral region varies with their site of origin and tumor type, but most present as a mass or an ulcerated mass and resemble squamous cell carcinoma or salivary neoplasm. Other lymphoid malignancies, such as plasmacytoma and Burkitt’s lymphoma, show a striking predilection for pri- mary involvement of bone. The microscopic characteriza- tion of specific lymphoma types is important because staging procedures and therapy may differ for each type. The only reliable method of distinguishing and characterizing
these lesions is by immunophenotyping with the use of tissue-based immunologic studies or by flow cytometry of material obtained by fine-needle aspiration. Lymphomas arising within the oral cavity account for less than 5% of oral malignancies. In the head and neck, lymphomas may be seen within regional lymph nodes and within extra- nodal lymphoid sites in areas known as gut associated or MALT (extending from the oral cavity to the anal region) (Figure 9-5). Within the oral cavity, lymphoid tissue is chiefly represented in Waldeyer’s ring; elsewhere within the oral cavity, it appears as unencapsulated, submucosal lymphoid tissue within the base of the tongue and soft palate, as well as within the major and minor salivary glands. The tonsils are the most common oropharyngeal site, followed by the palate (Figures 9-6 to 9-8). If bone is the primary site, alveolar bone loss and tooth mobility are often presenting signs (Figure 9-9). Swelling, pain, numb- ness of the lip, and pathologic fracture may be associated with bone lesions.
Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment of NHL depends on various factors, includ- ing the histologic type and grade of the tumor, the stage of the disease, the patient’s age, health, and immune status, and the patient’s wishes. Two modes of treatment are avail- able: radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Radiation ther- apy is used if the tumor is found in a specific localized field, and chemotherapy is used for nonlocalized or more widely distributed disease. Radiation therapy is typically delivered at the level of 40 to 50 Gy. Chemotherapy is given as a single- or multiple-drug regimen. The goal of chemother- apy is to maximize tumor toxicity while minimizing dam- age to normal tissues, particularly the hematopoietic tissues. A monoclonal antibody to CD20 antigen (Rituximab) is a newer adjuvant biologic treatment used for many B-cell lymphomas and leukemias, and some autoimmune diseases.

Disease relapse during the course of treatment is a poor prognostic sign and is likely related to the evolution of drug-resistant clones. If relapse occurs years after discon- tinuation of therapy, the tumor likely is still susceptible to the original chemotherapeutic agent. For some patients with indolent lymphomas, no treatment may be given ini- tially. Later, both radiation and chemotherapy can be used

if necessary. In general, the prognosis of indolent lym- phoma is poor. Although survival is long, with a mean time of 8 years, this group is considered incurable. For aggressive lymphomas, more than 90% of patients receive chemo- therapy. Multiple-agent chemotherapy will induce remis- sion in about 40% of patients. The goal of treatment is to extend the dose to the limits of tolerance by the patient. For

patients who respond, the outlook is good, with cures expected. For patients who do not respond, the outlook is poor. Similarly, highly aggressive lymphomas respond well to chemotherapy, with many patients having resolution of the disease after only one course of treatment. For non- responders, however, the disease is usually fatal within weeks.
Specific Lymphomas
In general, two basic histomorphologic groups of lymphomas are recognized: follicular (nodular) and diffuse forms. With- out treatment, the former group shows a more favorable prognosis. Follicular lymphomas show malignant cells arranged in uniformly sized nodules distributed throughout a lymph node or extranodal site. In lymphomas showing a dif- fuse pattern, abnormal cells are distributed uniformly through- out the involved tissue. In either case, the normal architecture of the lymphoid tissue is destroyed. Cytology, or the pre- dominant cell type within the lesion, is of great significance. Not all classified forms of lymphoma are discussed here, only entities of relevance to the head and neck. Specific antibodies used in the diagnosis of each type of lymphoma are detailed in Table 9-4. The cytogenetics and immunophenotyping of specific lymphomas are shown in Table 9-2 and Table 9-5.
Diffuse B-Cell Lymphoma
Diffuse B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive, rapidly growing neoplasm of large lymphoid cells. DLBCL usually arises de novo, but may represent transformation of a lower- grade lymphoma. They occur over a wide age range with a slight male predilection. DLBCL may present as lymphade- nopathy or in extranodal sites (Figure 9-10). Within bone, the tumor produces extensive destruction. Approximately 50% of all tumors present in stage I or II, and with treatment, 50% to 60% of patients can achieve prolonged disease-free survival.

   Microscopically, the tumor is composed of sheets of large lymphoid cells showing abundant cytoplasm and nuclei, comparable in size or larger than reactive histiocytes. Within lymph nodes, normal lymphoid architecture is ef- faced and necrosis is common. Some DLBCL are associated with EBV infection (so-called EBV-positive DLBCL of the elderly) where there is no identifiable cause of immunosup- pression or a history of prior lymphoma. These tumors are postulated to be caused by senescence of the immune sys- tem as a part of the aging process. EBV-positive DLBCL, including EBV-positive DLBCL of the elderly, respond
more poorly to treatment, with a poorer outcome compared with patients who have EBV-negative DLBCL.
Follicular B-Cell Lymphoma
Follicular B-cell lymphomas are tumors composed of follicu- lar center B lymphocytes arranged in nodules. This category of tumor accounts for 22% to 40% of all NHLs in whites, but only 5% to 10% of NHLs in Asians. It is typically a disease of older adults, presenting as a slowly growing, painless enlarge- ment of one or several lymph nodes. It is rare in the oral cavity. The tumor is characterized by a protracted clinical course

highlighted by numerous recurrences over several years. This tumor is essentially incurable, with a median survival of 5 to 10 years. Microscopically, there is effacement of normal lymph node architecture by neoplastic follicles composed of a range of follicular center–like cells, including small and large cleaved cells and, occasionally, large noncleaved cells.
Extranodal Marginal Zone B-cell Lymphoma
Extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma was previously known as lymphoma of MALT (mucosa-associated lymphoid
tissue). This indolent lymphoma occurs in mucosal sites and in extranodal tissues, including the gastrointestinal tract, salivary glands, lung, thyroid gland, and skin (Figure 9-11). Any age group or gender can be affected, although in some settings, such as those associated with Sjögren’s syndrome, a striking female predominance is evident. Predisposing factors for extra- nodal marginal zone lymphoma include Hashimoto’s thyroid- itis, Sjögren’s syndrome, Helicobacter pylori gastritis, and Borrelia burgdorferi skin infection (Lyme disease). These lym- phomas tend to localize to an involved organ for a protracted

time before dissemination. Most cases are treated with local- regional therapy, and the prognosis is excellent, with 5-year survival on the order of 75%.
Microscopically, unifocal or multifocal involvement of extranodal tissues can be seen. All extranodal marginal zone lymphomas share several histopathologic features regardless of site. The tumor is composed predominantly of centrocyte-like (CCL) cells morphologically resembling a range from lym- phocytes to monocytoid cells. In some tumors, the proportion of CCL cells showing plasmacytoid differentiation can be so extensive as to resemble a plasmacytoma. Clusters of CCL cells typically invade and destroy the epithelium to form lym- phoepithelial lesions, which can be few or extensive (see Figure 9-11). The tumor cells begin proliferation in the mar- ginal zone and gradually expand around reactive lymphoid follicles. Over time, the neoplastic CCL cells infiltrate the reac- tive follicles in one of three patterns termed follicular coloniza- tion. Occasionally, this can give the tumors a vague nodularity, which can lead to the misdiagnosis of a follicular lymphoma.
Mantle Cell Lymphoma
This B-cell lymphoma is derived from mantle zone cells of primary lymphoid follicles. The hallmark of this disease is the inappropriate overexpression of cyclin D1 protein. Mantle zone lymphoma occurs in middle-aged or older adults and has a striking male predominance. The condition typically presents as lymphadenopathy, but extranodal disease, includ- ing that in the spleen and gastrointestinal tract, is common. The clinical course is progressive, with an almost uniformly poor outcome. Most patients relapse within 24 months, with a 5-year survival rate of 30%. Histology shows a diffuse, vaguely nodular or nodular pattern of lymphocytes around residual reactive germinal centers. Cells are monotonous and small with indented or angulate nuclei but with a spherical shape. Pleomorphic or blastoid variants are recognized and pursue an even more aggressive clinical course.
B-Cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (B-CLL/SLL) is an indolent lymphoma composed of a neoplastic proliferation of small, well-differentiated lymphocytes (Figure 9-12). Most cases have a leukemic pre- sentation, and the lesions are rarely localized. The condition affects older patients and is typically an incidental finding in the peripheral blood. Bone marrow involvement at presenta- tion is common, and about 40% of patients have B-type symptoms. Many have infectious complications, and some develop autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Because the condi- tion is indolent and slowly progressive, many asymptomatic patients are not treated. B-CLL/SLL responds to single- agent chemotherapy, but cures are almost never achieved. The course of the disease is characterized by frequent relapses and death after many years. The median survival is 5 to 8 years. Histologically, the following are evident: effacement of lymph nodes by small lymphocytes with small, rounded nuclei, condensed chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli, and little cytoplasm.
• Figure 9-12 Small lymphocytic lymphoma.
Burkitt’s Lymphoma
Burkitt’s lymphoma (BL) is a highly aggressive B-cell lym- phoma that primarily afflicts children and adolescents. Three forms of the disease are recognized: an endemic type in Africa, a sporadic form occurring in North America and Europe, and a form associated with immunodeficiency.
Endemic BL is a disease of children that occurs in equatorial Africa, where endemic malaria may serve as a pathogenetic cofactor. Approximately 95% of this form is associated with EBV infection. Jaw involvement is charac- teristic of endemic BL; up to 50% of those afflicted have lesions of the maxilla or mandible. Other organs are com- monly involved, including the kidneys, liver, retroperito- neum, and gonads. Sporadic BL occurs in non-African countries and primarily affects young adults. This variety of BL often presents as an abdominal mass, and bone marrow involvement is more common than in the endemic form. Jaw lesions in sporadic BL are considerably less common than in endemic BL, occurring in approximately 10% of cases. BL can complicate HIV infection. Most patients are adults with marked immunosuppression. Tumor presenta- tion is noted both in lymph nodes and at extranodal sites, particularly the central nervous system (CNS), bone mar- row, and gastrointestinal tract. Although EBV has been identified in a large proportion of endemic BL, only 10% of cases of sporadic BL are associated with EBV infection. The outcome for endemic and sporadic BL depends on the stage at presentation. With aggressive chemotherapy protocols, the 5-year survival rate is greater than 75% for stages I to III, but only 25% for stage IV disease. For AIDS- associated BL, the prognosis is poor.
Microscopically, all forms of BL show similar findings consisting of monotonous sheets of densely packed, medium- sized neoplastic lymphocytes. The cytoplasm of the cells is deeply basophilic and often forms acute angles with neighboring cells in well-fixed sections. The tumor has a very high mitotic rate, with more than 10 mitoses per high-power field, and staining for the proliferation marker Ki-67 demonstrates that almost 100% of the tumor cells are dividing. Numerous macrophages containing cellular debris give the classic starry sky appearance to the tumor (Figure 9-13). Characteristic cytogenetic findings that

involve translocation of the c-myc gene on chromosome 8 with one of the immunoglobulin genes (heavy or light chain) on chromosome 2, 14, or 22 define the disease.
Lymphomas Associated with Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection
The development of NHL has long been recognized as a rare complication of many congenital immunodeficiency states. The increase in organ transplantation coupled with immunosuppression techniques has witnessed a marked
increase in the development of many lymphoproliferative disorders. The development of lymphoma in the setting of HIV infection is recognized as an important complication of AIDS (Figure 9-14). It is a relatively late complication of HIV infection, with some lymphomas, particularly immu- noblastic lymphoproliferations and plasmablastic lym- phoma, occurring primarily when marked depression of CD4 T cells is seen.
In contrast to lymphomas complicating other immunode- ficiency states, up to 75% of those arising in HIV infection

occur at extranodal sites, and almost one fifth occur in the CNS. Sites of involvement are relatively distinct in AIDS-related lymphomas and include the CNS, anorectal region, and oral cavity. NHLs account for 3% of all malig- nant tumors within the oral cavity in patients with HIV infection. The most commonly affected sites include the gingiva, palate, and fauces, which typically exhibit a rapidly growing mass and/or tooth mobility. Characteristically, these lymphomas present as widespread disease with systemic symptoms. Also, a large proportion of patients will develop spread to the CNS and bone marrow during the course of their disease. In AIDS, B-cell lymphomas predominate, although T-cell lymphomas are also seen. Most B-cell lym- phomas are plasmablastic, immunoblastic, or Burkitt’s-like lymphoma. Plasmablastic lymphoma is an aggressive B-cell lymphoma that occurs in the setting of HIV infection. It has a predilection for the oral cavity but can occur in other sites such as the GI tract and lymph nodes. Both EBV and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) have been implicated in the develop- ment of plasmablastic lymphoma, but the link with EBV is stronger. The prognosis for plasmablastic lymphoma is poor; reported average survival time is less than a year.
Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma
Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is an aggressive lymphoma of T-cell or natural killer (NK)-cell lineage that characteristically expresses the CD30 (Ki-1 or Ber-H2) an- tigen (Figure 9-15). Although expression of this antigen was thought to be specific for ALCL, it is now recognized that CD30 is an activation marker that can be expressed by other B-cell and T-cell lymphomas. It has been determined that the cytogenetic abnormality t(2;5) involving the NPM and ALK genes is an important characteristic of ALCL. The fact that up to 80% of ALCLs express the ALK protein in nuclei and cytoplasm of tumor cells makes this an impor- tant diagnostic immunohistochemical feature.
ALCL has a characteristic bimodal age distribution, af- fecting both adolescents and older adults. Males are affected more often than females. The lymphoma has a variable clinical presentation with both lymph node and extranodal
presentations, including skin, the gastrointestinal tract, and bone. Bone marrow involvement at presentation is variable, ranging from 10% to 40%, depending on whether mor- phologic or immunohistochemical methods are used for detection. Bone marrow involvement at presentation is a poor prognostic sign. Although the tumor is aggressive, it responds well to single- or multiple-agent chemotherapy, with a 5-year median survival rate of 77%. Histologically, many different patterns are noted. The prototypic form consists of large or very large cells with rounded or horse- shoe-shaped single or multiple nuclei. Occasionally, the nuclei are arranged in a wreathlike pattern. The cytoplasm is amphophilic and abundant. ALCL may be difficult to differentiate from other large cell neoplasms such as undif- ferentiated carcinoma and malignant melanoma, hence the need for immunophenotyping to diagnose the condition.
Natural Killer/T-Cell Lymphoma, Nasal Type
Progressive, ulcerative destruction of the palate, nose, and paranasal structures has long been recognized as a striking and potentially fatal condition. The term midline lethal granuloma was originally used to describe this condition, but various other terms have been suggested, including polymorphous reticulosis, lymphomatoid granulomatosis, idiopathic destructive disease, and midline malignant reticulosis. Evidence now shows that a variety of diseases, including Wegener’s granulomatosis, infectious agents, and lymphoma, were diagnosed as midline (lethal) granuloma. After exclusion of Wegener’s granulomatosis and infectious disease, remaining cases appear to be T-cell or NK-cell (NK/T-cell) lymphomas. At this site, it is often difficult to histologically separate T-cell lymphoma from NK-cell lym- phoma, hence the term nasofacial NK/T-cell lymphoma is preferred.
Nasofacial NK/T-cell lymphoma is an aggressive lymphoma of adults, with a median age at presentation of 53 years. Men are affected more often than women. Nasal symptoms are often the most common presenting feature, with epistaxis oc- casionally present. Some patients may present early on with swelling of the soft or hard palate. Over time, this evolves to

frank ulceration and destruction of the palatal and nasal tis- sues, often leading to an oronasal fistula. Without treatment, the relentless destruction of midface structures by the lympho- matous infiltrate can lead to death from hemorrhage or sec- ondary infection. Typically, the condition is treated with che- motherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of both. Reports of long-term survival vary, in part because of confusion regarding diagnosis of the condition. Overall survival from the time of diagnosis has been reported as ranging from 3 months to 14 years. More aggressive management has improved the prognosis to a 5-year disease-free survival of 78% for patients with early-stage lesions and 19% for those with more widely disseminated disease.
The microscopic appearance of nasofacial NK/T-cell lymphoma is characterized by the presence of varying amounts of granulation tissue and necrosis. An inflammatory infiltrate consists of a mixture of acute and chronic inflammatory cells intermingled with atypical lymphocytes that can range from a few to a predominant proportion of the infiltrate. These cells are medium-sized or large with a clear cytoplasm and an irregular nuclear outline. Some have prominent nucleoli and may resemble immunoblasts. Angiocentricity and epithelio- tropism are common histopathologic features of nasofacial NK/T-cell lymphoma. A minority of cases of midface destructive disease are caused by other types of lymphoma, including various B-cell lymphomas. EBV infection is typical and can be demonstrated by in situ hybridization methods.
Eosinophil-Rich CD30-Positive Lymphoproliferative Disorder
This unusual lymphoma has been reported in the oral cavity and resembles a similar appearing primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Clinically, the condition presents as a solitary ulcer, often of the tongue. Microscopically, the stromal cel- lular infiltrate is composed of small round lymphocytes and abundant eosinophils intermixed with an atypical popula- tion of small and medium-sized and sparse large cells with atypical nuclei and prominent nucleoli. The large cells express CD3 and CD30 antigens. By molecular analysis, the T-cell receptor is clonal, consistent with a neoplasm. The microscopy of eosinophil-rich CD30-positive lympho- proliferative disorders resembles traumatic ulcerative granu- loma (TEG) of the oral mucosa, a chronic but self-limiting reactive lesion, which has been known by several terms, including traumatic granuloma of the tongue, traumatic ulcerative granuloma with stromal eosinophilia, eosino- philic ulcer of the oral mucosa, oral traumatic granuloma, and eosinophilic granuloma of soft tissue. Despite its name, the relationship between TEG and trauma is unclear. The clinical course of eosinophil-rich CD30-positive lympho- proliferative disorder is not well understood because published cases are few, but it appears to follow an indolent course and some cases are cured with simple excision.
Hodgkin’s Lymphoma
Hodgkin’s lymphoma rarely involves the oral cavity, although there are cases in which this disease has appeared
in the soft tissues, as well as in the mandible and maxilla. On occasion, the oral manifestations may represent the primary site of involvement; in other cases, associated cervi- cal lymphadenopathy or more widespread disease may be noted concurrently.
Clinical Features
Generally, Hodgkin’s lymphoma occurs over a wide age spectrum, with clustering of patients between 15 and 35 years of age and beyond 55 years of age. A slight male predilection has been noted. Clinically, Hodgkin’s lym- phoma is characterized by painless enlargement of lymph nodes or extranodal lymphoid tissue. Within the oral cavity, tonsillar enlargement, usually unilateral, may be seen in the early phases. When extranodal sites are involved, submucosal swellings may be seen, sometimes with mucosal ulceration or erosion of underlying bone. Subsequent to microscopic diagnosis, clinical staging must be undertaken. This may consist of physical examination, radiographic imaging, lym- phangiography, and laparotomy. After the staging proce- dure, a definitive treatment plan is established. Box 9-1 provides details of the Ann Arbor system of clinical staging.
Histopathology
Of greatest significance is identification of one of several forms of the Reed-Sternberg cell, which must be present for the diagnosis of Hodgkin’s lymphoma to be established. In its most common form, this cell of lymphocytic origin is characterized by its large size and bilobed nucleus; each lobe contains a large amphophilic or eosinophilic nucleolus. The nuclear chromatin pattern is vesicular and condensed at the periphery. Other Reed-Sternberg cells may be characterized by two nuclei with a prominent nucleolus or by multiple nuclei. Cells similar to Reed-Sternberg cells may be seen in certain viral diseases, such as infectious mononucleosis and BL, as well as in patients with treated lymphocytic lym- phoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or some benign immunoblastic proliferations.
The WHO system for classifying Hodgkin’s lymphoma is the most current and most widely used system. It is based on two earlier systems: the Lukes-Butler and Rye schemes. Clas- sic Hodgkin’s lymphoma comprises four entities: (1) lympho- cyte-rich, classic; (2) nodular sclerosis; (3) mixed cellularity; and (4) lymphocyte depletion types. The WHO system has added lymphocyte predominant, nodular, which is not a clas- sic type. The lymphocyte-rich, classic type has the most favor- able prognosis, and the lymphocyte depletion type has the least favorable prognosis. In the lymphocyte-rich, classic form, a small, mature lymphocyte is the most prevalent cell, but it is mixed with scattered macrophages. Few Reed-Sternberg cells are seen in this form of the disease.
The most common form of Hodgkin’s lymphoma is the nodular-sclerosing type, which accounts for more than 50% of cases. It is characterized by bands of collagen that origi- nate from the periphery and penetrate into the lymph node, subdividing it into islands of tumor that contain Reed- Sternberg cells.
 
www.konkur.in
The mixed cellularity type of Hodgkin’s lymphoma contains a combination of lymphocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils, plasma cells, and macrophages, and many Reed-Sternberg cells. The mixed cellularity type of Hodg- kin’s lymphoma carries a prognosis that is intermediate between the nodular sclerosing type and the lymphocyte depletion form.
In the lymphocyte depletion form of Hodgkin’s disease, the chief microscopic characteristic is abundant pleomor- phic Reed-Sternberg cells and relatively few lymphocytes.
Differential Diagnosis
Cervical lymphadenopathy would suggest conditions rang- ing from inflammatory to neoplastic. Specified entities that can produce lymph node enlargement include chronic lymphadenitis, infectious disease, and lymphoma. In young patients, infectious mononucleosis should be considered. Nonlymphoid lateral neck lesions that could be included in a clinical differential diagnosis encompass salivary gland tumors, cervical lymphoepithelial cyst, carotid body tumor, and metastatic cancer.
Treatment and Prognosis
Clinical staging and histologic classification of Hodgkin’s dis- ease are critical in determining management and prognosis. The lymphocyte-rich, classic form of disease carries with it the most favorable prognosis, and the lymphocyte depletion form
has the worst prognosis. Stage I disease has the best prognosis, and stage IV (disseminated disease) the worst. Generally, the clinical stage has a greater influence on the overall prognosis than does the histologic subtype. Management of Hodgkin’s disease consists of external radiation therapy and multiple- agent chemotherapy. What was once a fatal illness with poor survival statistics has become a curable disease. Most patients with Hodgkin’s disease are cured because of treatment with intensive radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy.
Multiple Myeloma/Plasmacytoma
Plasma cell neoplasms include multiple myeloma, solitary plasmacytoma of bone, and extramedullary plasmacytoma and are characterized by expansion of a clone of immuno- globulin-secreting cells (Figure 9-16) (see also Chapter 14). The biological behavior of these conditions varies, although histologically, all contain monotonous sheets of neoplastic cells resembling plasma cells. The cell population may vary from small, well-differentiated cells with an eccentric nu- cleus and basophilic cytoplasm to less well differentiated, atypical cells resembling immunoblasts.
The most common and important plasma cell neoplasm is multiple myeloma characterized by multiple osteolytic bone lesions, serum or urinary M proteins, and bone mar- row biopsy findings showing greater than 10% plasma cell composition (Figure 9-17). Symptoms are related to infil- tration of organs by neoplastic plasma cells and by excessive

production of immunoglobulins having abnormal bio- chemical properties. Pathologic fractures occur in 20% of patients. Advanced disease is associated with hypercalcemia and renal failure. Bone marrow infiltration leads to anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytopenia, with the latter resulting in increased susceptibility to infection. Jaw lesions
can be identified in 30% of cases of multiple myeloma and radiographically appear as noncorticated, well-defined ra- diolucencies that are more common in the mandible than in the maxilla (Figures 9-18 to 9-20). The posterior por- tions of the jaw are more commonly affected because the marrow spaces are larger. The formation of amyloid from the aggregation of immunoglobulin light-chain proteins is a common sequela of multiple myeloma and when depos- ited in the tongue can produce macroglossia. Treatment of multiple myeloma is directed at reducing the tumor burden and reversing complications of the disease, such as those related to renal failure or osteolytic tumor foci. Single-agent or multiagent alkylating chemotherapy is the treatment of choice for multiple myeloma. New agents such as the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and the antiangiogenic immunomodulator thalidomide and its analogs, such as lenalidomide, have been studied alone and in combination with other antineoplastic therapies; as induction therapy before stem cell transplantation or in patients with relapsed disease, they may offer promise for future therapies.
A solitary focus of lytic bone destruction showing a plasma cell tumor without bone marrow involvement is

termed solitary plasmacytoma of bone. This lesion consti- tutes 3% of all plasma cell neoplasms and is believed to represent a localized myeloma. Involvement of the facial bones is rare and, when present, typically represents dis- seminated disease. Progression to myeloma occurs in 30% to 75% of cases, although long-term survival is common. Solitary lesions are typically treated with radiation therapy supplemented by chemotherapy. When the disease is dis- seminated, it is treated as myeloma.
Isolated plasma cell tumors within soft tissues are termed extramedullary plasmacytoma. This definition excludes tu- mors that have arisen in bone, involving soft tissues second- arily, following perforation of the bone cortex. More than 80% of all extramedullary plasmacytomas arise in the upper respiratory tract and oral cavity, accounting for 4% of all nonepithelial neoplasms of the nose, nasopharynx, and pa- ranasal sinuses. The clinical appearance is of a dark red, fleshy mass that rarely ulcerates. Multiple lesions at other sites in the head and neck are seen in 20% of patients, and up to 40% may have involvement of regional lymph nodes. Unlike with multiple myeloma and solitary plasmacytoma of bone, wide dissemination is rare and typically shows no preference for active hematopoietic sites. In contrast to the behavior of solitary plasmacytoma of bone, many reports have shown that the progression of extramedullary plasma- cytoma to myeloma is distinctly uncommon. Extramedul- lary plasmacytomas are radiosensitive, and regional control rates of 80% can be achieved.
A complication not infrequently associated with multiple myeloma is amyloidosis (Figures 9-21 and 9-22). Amyloid is the deposition of complex proteins in tissues that, when stained with the dye Congo red, shows apple green birefrin- gence under polarized light. Several forms of amyloid may

occur in various clinical conditions, including multiple myeloma, some chronic inflammatory diseases, and several hereditary conditions. The constituent proteins of each con- dition differ, but common to all is a unique protein folding pattern known as a beta-pleated sheet. By electron micros- copy, all amyloid has a fibrillar appearance. The most com- mon proteins making up amyloid are immunoglobulin light chains (Table 9-6). Other proteins that can aggregate into amyloid include liver-derived amyloid-associated nonimmu- noglobulin protein, transthyretin, beta 2-microglobulin, and some keratins. In multiple myeloma, excess immunoglobu- lin light chains are produced and combine to form amyloid. These are deposited in organs such as the kidney, replacing normal tissues and resulting in organ dysfunction. Also in multiple myeloma, nodular or diffuse deposits of amyloid may be seen on the tongue, producing macroglossia.

stories; over 80% of patients with AML achieve complete remission with aggressive chemotherapy. Several decades ago, ALL was almost uniformly fatal. For those who relapse, cure is rare without bone marrow transplantation. Between 60% and 90% of these patients with ALL achieve remission.
Chronic Leukemias
Both chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and chronic lympho- cytic leukemia (CLL) are diseases of adults. The incidence of CML is highest in the fourth and fifth decades of life and rare in children. CLL occurs more commonly than other types of leukemia and has a median age at diagnosis in the seventh decade of life. Most patients with CML are asymptomatic. Some may have fatigue, weight loss, fever, and night sweats. Symptoms related to splenomegaly may also occur. CLL is also most commonly asymptomatic at diagnosis, although as the disease progresses, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and hepa- tomegaly may occur. The diagnosis of chronic leukemia is made by examination of the peripheral blood and by bone marrow biopsy. A common complication of CML, particularly the myelomonocytic and monocytic forms, is generalized gin- gival hypertrophy (Figure 9-23). The gingiva is red, boggy, and edematous, and it bleeds easily. Sometimes this may be the initial presenting feature of CML. The gingival appearance is due to infiltration by neoplastic myeloid cells. Both CML and CLL are difficult to cure. CML is managed by chemotherapy, typically with hydroxyurea or busulfan. More recently, inter- feron-alpha and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib or Gleevac) have been used with clinical efficacy. CLL often is not treated if the patient is elderly or asymptomatic. Symptomatic CLL patients and those with extensive disease will receive alkylating chemotherapy, although cure is unlikely.
Granulocytic Sarcoma
Granulocytic sarcoma, also known as extramedullary my- eloid tumor, is a localized infiltrate of immature granulo- cytes in an extramedullary site that superficially resembles sarcoma clinically. Oral granulocytic sarcoma presents as a localized soft tissue mass, although less frequently intraosse- ous presentation has been reported. Clinically, granulocytic
• Figure 9-23 Chronic monocytic leukemia of the gingiva.
   Leukemias
Leukemias encompass a group of disorders characterized by neoplastic proliferation of bone marrow lymphocyte or myeloid precursors that replace the marrow and can be iden- tified in the peripheral blood. Neoplastic cells can also infil- trate other organs such as the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and other tissues. Various causes have been attributed to the de- velopment of specific forms of leukemia, including genetic factors such as specific chromosome translocations (t[9;22] in chronic myeloid leukemia), environmental agents such as benzene, ionizing radiation, and viruses such as human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) in adult T-cell leukemia.
Leukemias are classified on the basis of the type of pro- genitor cell (myeloid or lymphoid lineage) and the clinical presentation (acute or chronic). Acute leukemias are charac- terized by the presence of immature cells and a fulminant clinical course. Chronic leukemias are characterized by the presence of better-differentiated, mature cells and a more indolent clinical course.
Acute Leukemias
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a disease of adults, and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is predominantly a dis- ease of children. Patients with AML or ALL present with bleeding (due to thrombocytopenia), fatigue (due to ane- mia), and infection (due to agranulocytosis). Diagnosis is established by examination of the peripheral blood differ- ential and count and is confirmed by bone marrow biopsy findings showing greater than 5% blast cells. Treatment of ALL in children has been one of medicine’s great success

sarcoma may occur in three settings: in a patient previously known to have AML; as a sign of blast transformation in a patient with CML or another chronic myeloproliferative disorder; or in a patient who was previously healthy.
Granulocytic sarcoma may be difficult to differentiate histologically from other malignancies such as large cell lymphoma, poorly differentiated carcinoma, or even plas- macytoma (Figure 9-24). Crystalline, rodlike, intracyto- plasmic acidophilic bodies (Auer rods) can establish the diagnosis of both granulocytic sarcoma and AML; however, they may be present in less than 10% of cases. Diagnostic confirmation usually requires histochemical staining to demonstrate the presence of myeloperoxidase. Naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase and a-naphthol acetate esterase demonstrate the presence of granulocytic esterases. Specific markers of cluster differentiation (CD) typical of myeloid (granulocytic) lineage, including CD15, can also be dem- onstrated using immunohistochemistry.
The prognosis for granulocytic sarcoma is poor. In pa- tients with no history of leukemia, the frequent association with AML has prompted some clinicians to recommend chemotherapy regimens for patients with granulocytic sar- coma that are typical for the management of acute leuke- mia. Although few long-term survivors have been described, these individuals generally received chemotherapy shortly after diagnosis.

 A cyst is defined as an epithelial-lined pathologic cavity. Cysts of the maxilla, mandible, and perioral regions vary markedly in histogenesis, incidence, behavior, and treat- ment and can be divided into odontogenic cysts, nonodon- togenic cysts, pseudocysts, and neck cysts. In contrast to true cysts, pseudocysts lack an epithelial lining.
Odontogenic Cysts
Periapical (Radicular) Cyst
Periapical (radicular or apical periodontal) cysts are by far the most common cysts of the jaws. These inflammatory cysts derive their epithelial lining from the proliferation of small odontogenic epithelial residues (rests of Malassez) within the periodontal ligament.
Etiology and Pathogenesis
A periapical cyst develops from a preexisting periapical granuloma, which is a focus of chronically inflamed granulation tissue located at the apex of a nonvital tooth (Figures 10-1 and 10-2). Periapical granulomas are initi- ated and maintained by the degradation products of necrotic pulp tissue. Stimulation of the resident epithelial rests of Malassez occurs in response to the products of inflammation (Table 10-1). Cyst formation occurs as a result of epithelial proliferation, which helps to separate

the inflammatory stimulus (necrotic pulp) from the sur- rounding bone (Figure 10-3).
Breakdown of cellular debris within the cyst lumen raises the protein concentration, increasing osmotic pressure and resulting in fluid transport across the epithelial lining into

  the lumen from the connective tissue side. Fluid ingress assists in outward growth of the cyst. With osteoclastic bone resorption, the cyst expands. Other bone resorption factors, such as prostaglandins, interleukins, and proteinases, from inflammatory cells and cells in the peripheral portion of the lesion causes additional cyst enlargement.
Clinical Features
Periapical cysts constitute approximately one half to three fourths of all cysts in the jaw (Box 10-1). The age distribution peaks in the third through sixth decades. Of note is the relative rarity of periapical cysts in the first decade, even though caries

and nonvital teeth are rather common in this age group. Most cysts are located in the maxilla, especially the anterior region, followed by the maxillary posterior region, the mandibular posterior region, and finally the mandibular anterior region.
Periapical cysts are usually asymptomatic and often are dis- covered incidentally during routine dental radiographic exami- nation (Figures 10-4 and 10-5). They cause bone resorption but generally do not produce bone expansion. By definition, a nonvital tooth is necessary for the diagnosis of a periapical cyst.
Radiographically, a periapical cyst cannot be differentiated from a periapical granuloma. Studies have shown that a provi- sional radiographic diagnosis was correct in 48% of cases for

periapical granuloma and 36% for radicular cyst, with an inci- dence of cystic change in inflammatory periapical lesions of pulpal origin of approximately 30%. Use of more advanced radiographic techniques such as cone beam computed tomog- raphy (CBCT) has not been shown to increase the level of accuracy in distinguishing periapical granulomas from radicu- lar cysts. The radiolucency associated with a periapical cyst is generally round to ovoid, with a narrow, opaque margin that is contiguous with the lamina dura of the involved tooth. This peripheral radiopaque component may not be apparent if the cyst is rapidly enlarging. Cysts range from a few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter, although most measure less than 1.5 cm. In long-standing cysts, root resorption of the of- fending tooth and occasionally of adjacent teeth may be seen.
Histopathology
The periapical cyst is lined by nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium of variable thickness (Figure 10-6).
• Figure 10-6 Periapical cyst with a chronic inflammatory cell infil- trate and nonkeratinized epithelial lining.
Transmigration of inflammatory cells through the epithelium is common, with large numbers of neutrophils (polymorpho- nuclear leukocytes [PMNs]) and fewer numbers of lympho- cytes involved. The underlying supportive connective tissue may be focally or diffusely infiltrated with a mixed inflamma- tory cell population. The molecular signature of a periapical granuloma differs from that of the radicular cyst, with a high level of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity compared with that within a radicular cyst. Plasma cell infiltrates, associ- ated refractile, and spherical intracellular Russell bodies, repre- senting accumulated gamma globulin, are often found, and sometimes dominate, the microscopic picture. Foci of dystro- phic calcification, cholesterol clefts, and multinucleated foreign body–type giant cells may be seen subsequent to hemorrhage in the cyst wall. A foreign body reaction to vegetable matter (Figure 10-7) (pulse or seed granuloma) is occasionally found in periapical cyst walls, indicating apical communication with the oral cavity through the root canal and carious lesion.
In a small percentage of periapical cysts (and dentigerous cysts), hyaline bodies, or Rushton bodies, may be found. These hairpin or slightly curved shaped, somewhat refractile, structures are found only within the epithelial lining of odon- togenic cysts but are of no clinical significance. Their origin

Cysts of the Jaws and Neck
is unclear, but they are believed to be the secretory product of odontogenic epithelium deposited on the surface of particu- late matter such as cell debris or cholesterol crystals. Prior theories, including elsastotic degeneration, the product of a cellular reaction to serum or other blood products, or kerati- nous origin, are no longer supported.
Differential Diagnosis
Radiographically, a differential diagnosis for periapical cyst must include periapical granuloma. In areas of previously treated apical pathology, a surgical defect or a periapical scar might also be considered. In the anterior mandible, periapical radiolucency should be distinguished from the earliest devel- opmental phase of periapical cemento-osseous dysplasia. In the posterior quadrants, apical radiolucencies must be distin- guished from a traumatic bone cyst. Occasionally, develop- mental odontogenic cysts, odontogenic tumors, giant cell lesions, metastatic disease, and primary osseous tumors may mimic a periapical cyst radiographically. In all of these con- siderations, associated teeth are vital.
Treatment and Prognosis
A periapical lesion (cyst/granuloma) may be successfully managed by extraction of the associated nonvital tooth and curettage of the apical zone. Alternatively, a root canal filling may be performed in association with an apicoec- tomy and direct curettage of the lesion. The third, and most often used, option involves performing a root canal filling only, because most periapical lesions are granulo- mas and resolve after removal of the inflammatory stimu- lus (necrotic pulp). Surgery (apicoectomy and curettage) is performed for lesions that are persistent, indicating the presence of a cyst or inadequate root canal treatment. The presence of endodontic filling material within a significant proportion of persistent apical radiolucencies following endodontic treatment suggests a possible causal relation- ship, with emphasis directed toward proper treatment to restrict extrusion of filling material beyond the periapex.
When the necrotic tooth is extracted but the cyst lining is incompletely removed, a residual cyst may develop months to years after the initial extirpation (Figure 10-8).
If a residual cyst or the original periapical cyst remains untreated, continued growth can cause significant bone re- sorption and weakening of the mandible or maxilla. Com- plete bone repair is usually seen in adequately treated peri- apical and residual cysts.
Lateral Periodontal Cyst
A lateral periodontal cyst is a nonkeratinized developmen- tal cyst occurring adjacent or lateral to the root of a tooth. Gingival cysts of the adult are histogenetically and patho- logically similar and are also discussed here.
Etiology and Pathogenesis
The origin of this cyst is believed to be related to prolif- eration of rests of dental lamina. The lateral periodontal cyst has been pathogenetically linked to the gingival cyst of the adult; the former is believed to arise from dental lamina remnants within bone, and the latter from dental lamina remnants in soft tissue between the oral epithelium and the periosteum (rests of Serres). The close relationship between the two entities is further supported by their similar distribution in sites containing a higher concentra- tion of dental lamina rests, and their identical histology.
Clinical Features
Most lateral periodontal cysts and gingival cysts of the adult occur in the mandibular premolar and cuspid regions and occasionally in the incisor area (Figure 10-9; Box 10-2). In the maxilla, lesions are noted primarily in the lateral incisor region. A distinct male predilection has been noted for lat- eral periodontal cysts, with a greater than 2:1 distribution.

Most found in mandibular canine-premolar area Males affected more than females
Treated by cystectomy; multilocular variant has recurrence potential
Dental lamina rests in soft tissue give rise to gingival cysts of adult.
Gingival cysts show a nearly equal gender predilection. The median age for both types of cysts is between the fifth and sixth decades of life, with a range of 20 to 85 years for lateral periodontal cysts, and 40 to 75 years for gingival cysts of the adult.
Clinically, a gingival cyst appears as a small soft tissue swelling within or slightly inferior to the interdental papilla (Figure 10-10). It may assume a slightly bluish discolor- ation when it is relatively large. Most cysts are less than 1 cm in diameter. Radiography reveals no findings.
A lateral periodontal cyst presents as an asymptomatic, well-delineated, round or teardrop-shaped unilocular (and occasionally multilocular) radiolucency with an opaque margin along the lateral surface of a vital tooth root. Root divergence is rarely seen. The term botryoid odontogenic cyst is often used when the lesion is multilocular.
Histopathology
Both the lateral periodontal cyst (Figure 10-11) and the gingival cyst of the adult (Figure 10-12) are lined by a thin, nonkeratinized epithelium. Clusters of glycogen-rich, clear epithelial cells may be noted in nodular thickenings of the cyst lining.
Differential Diagnosis
The lateral periodontal cyst must be distinguished from a cyst resulting from an inflammatory stimulus through lateral root

canal of a nonvital tooth (a lateral radicular cyst), an odonto- genic keratocyst along the lateral root surface, and radiolucent odontogenic tumors. A differential diagnosis for the gingival cyst would include gingival mucocele, Fordyce’s granules, parulis, and possibly a peripheral odontogenic tumor.
Treatment and Prognosis
Local excision of both gingival and lateral periodontal cysts is generally curative. The multilocular variant, botryoid odontogenic cyst seems to have increased recurrence poten- tial. Follow-up is suggested for treated multilocular odonto- genic cysts.
Gingival Cyst of the Newborn
Gingival cysts of the newborn are also known as dental lamina cysts of the newborn, or Bohn’s nodules. These cysts typically appear as multiple nodules along the alveo- lar ridge in neonates. It is believed that fragments of the dental lamina that remain within the alveolar ridge mucosa after tooth formation proliferate to form these small, keratinized cysts. In the vast majority of cases, these cysts are self-limiting and degenerate, and they involute or rupture into the oral cavity within a few weeks to a few

months. Histologically, this cyst is lined by a bland strati- fied squamous epithelium (Figure 10-13). Treatment is not necessary because nearly all of these cysts involute spontaneously or rupture before the patient is 3 months of age. Similar epithelial inclusion cysts may occur along the midline of the palate (palatine cysts of the newborn, or Epstein’s pearls). These cysts are of developmental origin and are derived from epithelium that is included in the fusion line between the palatal shelves and the nasal pro- cesses. No treatment is necessary because they fuse with the overlying oral epithelium, discharge their contents, and resolve spontaneously.
Dentigerous Cyst
Dentigerous or follicular cysts are the second most com- mon type of odontogenic cyst, and the most common developmental cyst of the jaws. In children from 2 to 14 years of age, dentigerous cysts account for 49% of intraosseous cystic lesions, with eruption cysts, odonto- genic keratocysts, and radicular cysts accounting for more than 10% each. By definition, a dentigerous cyst is attached to the tooth cervix at the cementoenamel junc- tion, and it encloses the crown of the unerupted tooth.
Etiology and Pathogenesis
A dentigerous cyst develops from proliferation of the enamel organ remnant or reduced enamel epithelium. As with other cysts, expansion of the dentigerous cyst is related to an increase in cyst fluid osmolality and the release of bone resorption factors.
Clinical Features
Dentigerous cysts are most commonly seen in associa- tion with third molars and maxillary canines, which are the most commonly impacted teeth (Box 10-3; Figure 10-14). The highest incidence of dentigerous cysts occurs during the second and third decades. A greater incidence in males has been noted, with a ratio of 1.6:1 reported.

Symptoms generally are absent, and delayed eruption is the most common indication of dentigerous cyst formation. This cyst is capable of achieving significant size, occasionally with associated cortical bone expansion, but rarely does it reach a size that predisposes the patient to a pathologic fracture.
Radiographically, a dentigerous cyst presents as a well- defined, unilocular radiolucency with corticated margins in association with the crown of an unerupted tooth. The un- erupted tooth is often displaced (Figure 10-15). These cysts range in size from several millimeters to several centimeters, where they may compromise jawbone integrity and pro- duce facial asymmetry. In the mandible, associated radiolu- cency may extend superiorly from the third molar site into the ramus or anteriorly and inferiorly along the body of the mandible. In maxillary dentigerous cysts involving the canine region, extension into the maxillary sinus or to the orbital floor may be noted. Resorption of roots of adjacent erupted teeth may occasionally be seen.

• Figure 10-19 Dentigerous cyst, epithelial lining containing Rush- ton bodies; an incidental finding of no significance.
dentigerous cyst, the epithelial lining is nonkeratinized and tends to be approximately four to six cell layers thick. On occasion, numerous mucous cells, ciliated cells, and, rarely, sebaceous cells may be found in the lining of the epithe- lium. The epithelium–connective tissue junction is gener- ally flat, although in cases of secondary inflammation, epithelial hyperplasia may be noted.
Differential Diagnosis
A differential diagnosis of pericoronal radiolucency should include odontogenic keratocyst, ameloblastoma, and other odontogenic tumors. Ameloblastic transforma- tion of a dentigerous cyst lining should be part of the differential diagnosis. Adenomatoid odontogenic tumor would be a further consideration with anterior pericoro- nal radiolucencies, and ameloblastic fibroma would be a possibility for lesions occurring in the posterior jaws of young patients.
Treatment
Removal of the associated tooth and enucleation of the pericoronal soft tissue component constitute definitive therapy in most instances. In cases in which cysts affect significant portions of the mandible, an acceptable early
treatment approach involves exteriorization or marsupial- ization of the cyst to allow for decompression and sub- sequent shrinkage of the lesion, thereby reducing the extent of surgery to be done at a later date.
Potential complications of untreated dentigerous cysts include transformation of the epithelial lining into an ameloblastoma and rarely, carcinomatous transformation of the epithelial lining. It has been suggested that the presence of mucous cells may indicate the potential for development of the rare intraosseous mucoepidermoid carcinoma. This is speculative because the evidence is anecdotal; the presence of mucous cells may indicate mucus metaplasia or a glandular odontogenic cyst.
Eruption Cyst
An eruption cyst results from fluid accumulation within the follicular space of an erupting tooth (Figure 10-20). The epithelium lining this space is simply reduced enamel epithe- lium. With trauma, blood may appear within the tissue space, forming an eruption hematoma. No treatment is needed be- cause the tooth erupts through the lesion. Subsequent to erup- tion, the cyst disappears spontaneously without complication.
Glandular Odontogenic Cyst
The rare glandular odontogenic cyst, or sialo-odontogenic cyst, was first described in 1987. It shares some histologic features with a mucus-producing salivary gland tumor (low-grade mu- coepidermoid carcinoma), but is regarded as a distinct entity. This difference is further supported by cytogenetic analysis of glandular odontogenic cysts showing absence of the mucoepi- dermoid carcinoma-specific MAML2 gene translocation.
Clinical Features
A strong predilection is seen for the mandible (80%), espe- cially the anterior mandible (Box 10-4; Figure 10-21). Maxillary lesions tend to be localized to the anterior seg- ment. A slow growth rate is characteristic and symptoms are absent. Jaw expansion is not uncommon, particularly in association with mandibular lesions. The gender ratio is ap- proximately 1:1. The mean age is 50 years, with a wide age range from the second through ninth decades.

Radiographic Features
Most cases are radiographically multiloculated. In cases in which a unilocular radiolucency has been noted initially, recurrent lesions have tended to be multiloculated. Lesions that have been reported have exhibited a wide variation in size, from smaller than 1 cm to involving most of the man- dible bilaterally. Radiographic margins are well defined and sclerotic and scalloped. Teeth may be displaced, and root resorption is noted in some cases. More aggressive lesions have shown a poorly defined peripheral border.
Histopathology
Histologically, this multilocular cyst is lined by nonkera- tinized epithelium with focal thickenings in which the epithelial cells assume a swirled appearance. The epithelial lining consists of cuboidal cells, often with cilia at the lumi- nal surface. Mucous cells are clustered in the cyst lining
along with mucin pools. The overall histomorphology is reminiscent of a cystic low-grade mucoepidermoid carci- noma (Figures 10-22 and 10-23).
Treatment and Prognosis
This lesion can be considered locally aggressive; therefore, surgical management should be dictated by the clinical and radiographic extent of the disease. Where adequate healthy bone remains beyond the extent of the cystic lesion, periph- eral curettage or marginal excision is appropriate. Long- term follow-up is essential given the local aggressiveness and recurrence rate (approximately 25%) of this lesion.
Odontogenic Keratocyst/Keratocystic Odontogenic Tumor
Odontogenic keratocyst (OKC) fulfills the definition of a cyst, that is, a pathologic space filled with fluid or semi- solid material lined by epithelium. Also, that it can be reduced in size or even ablated in some cases by marsu- pialization would seem to support a cyst classification. However, other factors such as recurrence rate, overex- pression of cell cycle proteins, and an association with a proliferation-related genetic mutation indicate that the OKC may be a cystic neoplasm. A new name has been proposed for this lesion, keratocystic odontogenic tumor (KCOT). In any event, classification of this well recog- nized entity as an aggressive cyst or as benign neoplasm

is academic. Rather, the real importance is the apprecia- tion of its potential behavior, possible syndrome associa- tion, and proper management.
Odontogenic keratocysts (OKC/KCOT) may exhibit aggressive clinical behavior, a relatively high recurrence rate, and an association with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syn- drome (NBCCS). They are found anywhere in the jaws and can radiographically mimic other types of cysts and some odontogenic tumors. Microscopically, however, they have a consistent and unique appearance.
Etiology and Pathogenesis
It is generally agreed that OKCs/KCOTs develop from dental lamina remnants in the mandible and maxilla. However, origin of this cyst from extension of basal cells of the overlying oral epithelium has also been suggested. Factors that may contribute to the pathogenesis of the OKC/KCOT include a high proliferation rate, overex- pression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 and several growth factors, and expression of MMPs 2 and 9 (Box 10-5). Studies on NBCCS and sporadic OKCs/ KCOTs have provided evidence of a two-hit genetic mechanism at two or more chromosome loci on chro- mosome 9q22.3, leading to overexpression of several proteins, including cyclin D1 and p53. Central to the development of OKCs/KCOTs are mutations of the PTCH gene mapped to chromosome 9p22.3-q31. The defective gene associated with NBCCS was found to be homologous to the Drosophila (fruit fly) patched (PTCH) gene. The protein product of the PTCH gene (a tumor-suppressor gene) is a component of the hedge- hog-signaling pathway and is essential for development during embryogenesis and cell signaling in the adult. The PTCH gene product normally represses the activity of the so-called sonic hedgehog protein and other signaling proteins, such as smoothened (SMO) protein. If the PTCH gene is nonfunctional, overexpression of sonic hedgehog and/or smoothened proteins occurs, leading to increased cell proliferation. Mutations of the PTCH gene are involved in the development of human

syndromic basal cell carcinoma and are present in a pro- portion of sporadic basal cell carcinomas (as well as medulloblastomas), providing further evidence of the crucial role of PTCH as a tumor suppressor in human keratinocytes. PTCH mutations are also found in OKCs/KCOTs in NBCCS patients and probably in many OKCs/KCOTs that occur sporadically. Thus, the currently proposed change in terminology from OKC to KCOT reflects the concept that these are cystic tumors and not developmental cysts.
Clinical Features
OKCs/KCOTs are relatively common jaw cysts (Box 10-6; Figures 10-24 and 10-25). They occur at any age and have a peak incidence within the second and third decades. Lesions found in children are often reflec- tive of multiple cysts as a component of NBCCS. OKCs/ KCOTs represent 5% to 15% of all odontogenic cysts. Approximately 5% of patients with OKCs/KCOTs have multiple cysts (Figure 10-26), and another 5% have NBCCS.
OKCs/KCOTs are found in the mandible in an approximate 2:1 ratio. In the mandible, the posterior por- tion of the body and the ramus region are most commonly affected, and in the maxilla, the third molar area is most commonly affected.

Radiographically, an OKC/KCOT characteristically presents as a well-circumscribed radiolucency with smooth radiopaque margins (Figures 10-27 and 10-28). Multi- locularity is often present and tends to be seen more com- monly in larger lesions. Most lesions, however, are uni- locular, with as many as 40% noted adjacent to the crown of an unerupted tooth (dentigerous cyst presentation). Approximately 30% of maxillary and 50% of mandibular lesions produce buccal expansion. Mandibular lingual enlargement is occasionally seen.
Histopathology
The epithelial lining is uniformly thin, generally ranging from 6 to 10 cell layers thick. The basal layer exhibits a

• Figure 10-28 Multiloculated odontogenic keratocyst of the man- dibular ramus.
characteristic palisaded pattern with polarized and in- tensely stained nuclei of uniform diameter. The luminal epithelial cells are parakeratinized and produce an un- even or corrugated profile. Focal zones of orthokeratini- zation can be seen. Additional histologic features that may occasionally be encountered include budding of the basal cells into the connective tissue wall and microcyst formation. The fibrous connective tissue component of the cyst wall is often free of an inflammatory cell infil- trate and is relatively thin. The epithelium–connective tissue interface is characteristically flat with no epithelial ridge formation. All so-called primordial cysts (cyst in place of a tooth), when examined microscopically, are OKCs/KCOTs (Box 10-7; Figures 10-29 to 10-33).
An orthokeratinized odontogenic cyst has been de- scribed and is about one twentieth as common as the OKC/KCOT (Figure 10-34). Histologic distinction be- tween parakeratinized and orthokeratinized cysts is made because the latter type of cyst is less clinically aggressive, has a lower rate of recurrence, and generally is not syndrome

Treatment and Prognosis
Surgical excision with peripheral osseous curettage or ostectomy is the preferred method of management. This more aggressive approach for a cystic lesion is justified by the high recurrence rate associated with OKCs/KCOTs. Some have advocated surgical decompression and marsupialization to permit cyst shrinkage, followed by enucleation as an alternative.
The recurrence rate varies from 10% to 30% depending on how the lesion is managed and is also related to several physical factors. The friable, thin connective tissue wall of the cyst may lead to incomplete removal. Small dental lamina remnants or satellite cysts in the bone adjacent to the primary lesion may contribute to recurrence. Also, cystic proliferation of the overlying oral epithelial basal cell layer, if not elimi- nated during cyst removal, is considered significant by some. Actual biological qualities of the cyst epithelium, such as an increased mitotic index and production of bone resorption factors, may be associated with recurrence.
Follow-up examinations are important for patients with this lesion. Patients should be evaluated for completeness of excision, new keratocysts, and NBCCS. Most recurrences become clinically evident within 5 years of treatment. Aside from the recurrence potential, ameloblastic transformation is a rare complication. Patients with multiple keratocysts have a significantly higher rate of recurrence than those with single keratocysts (30% and 10%, respectively).
Clinical manifestations of NBCCS include multiple OKCs/ KCOTs, bone defects, and multiple basal cell carcinomas (Figure 10-35; Box-10-8). The other cutaneous abnormalities include palmar and plantar keratotic pitting, multiple milia, and dermal calcinosis. Common bone defects include bifid ribs (Figure 10-36), kyphoscoliosis, vertebral, and metacarpal ab- normalities. Mild mandibular prognathism has been recorded in a small percentage of cases. Facial dysmorphogenesis, in- cluding a broad nasal bridge with corresponding ocular hyper- telorism and laterally displaced inner ocular canthi (dystopia canthorum), may be seen. Neurologic abnormalities, including medulloblastoma, dysgenesis or agenesis of the corpus callo- sum, calcification of the falx cerebri (Figure 10-37), and (less often) calcification of the falx cerebelli, have been documented.

Calcifying Odontogenic Cyst (Calcifying Cystic Odontogenic Tumor)
Calcifying odontogenic cysts (COCs) are developmental odontogenic lesions that occasionally exhibit recurrence (Box 10-9). Similar to the OKC/KCOT, the term calcifying cystic odontogenic tumor has been proposed for this lesion to reflect its dual cystic and benign neoplastic nature. A solid variant known as odontogenic ghost cell tumor is believed to potentially exhibit more aggressive clinical behavior.
Etiology and Pathogenesis
COCs are believed to be derived from odontogenic epithelial remnants within the gingiva or within the mandible or maxilla.
Clinical Features

Ghost cell keratinization, the characteristic microscopic feature of this cyst, is also a defining feature of the cutaneous lesion known as calcifying epithelioma of Malherbe, or pilomatrix- oma. In the jaws, ghost cells may be seen in other odontogenic tumors, including odontomas, ameloblastomas, adenomatoid odontogenic tumors, ameloblastic fibro-odontomas, and am- eloblastic fibromas and therefore, their presence is not necessar- ily a defining feature of the lesion. Mutations of genes in the WNT signaling pathway, including the beta-catenin gene, have been reported in COCs.
Clinical Features
A wide age range has been reported for this cyst, with a peak incidence in the second decade. It usually appears in individu- als younger than 40 years of age and has a decided predilection for females. More than 70% of COCs are seen in the maxilla. Rarely, COCs may present as localized extraosseous masses involving the gingiva. Those presenting in an extraosseous or peripheral location are usually noted in individuals older than 50 years of age and are found anterior to the first molar region.
Radiographically, COCs may present as unilocular or multilocular radiolucencies with discrete, well-demarcated margins (Figures 10-38 and 10-39). Within the radiolu- cency may be scattered, irregularly sized calcifications. Such opacities may produce a salt-and-pepper type of pattern, with an equal and diffuse distribution. In some cases, min- eralization may develop to such an extent that the radio- graphic margins of the lesion are difficult to determine.
Histopathology
Most COCs present as well-delineated cystic proliferations with a fibrous connective tissue wall lined by odontogenic epithelium. Intraluminal epithelial proliferation occasion- ally obscures the cyst lumen, thereby producing the impres- sion of a solid tumor. The epithelial lining is of variable thickness. The basal epithelium may be prominent focally, with hyperchromatic nuclei and a cuboidal to columnar pattern. Above the basal layer are more loosely arranged epithelial cells, sometimes resembling the stellate reticulum

of the enamel organ. The most prominent and unique microscopic feature is the presence of so-called ghost cell keratinization. Ghost cells are anucleate and retain the out- line of the cell membrane. These cells undergo dystrophic mineralization characterized by fine basophilic granularity, which may eventually result in large sheets of calcified ma- terial (Figures 10-40 and 10-41). On occasion, ghost cells may become displaced in the connective tissue wall, elicit- ing a foreign body giant cell response.
Differential Diagnosis
In the early stages of formation, COCs may have little or no mineralization and therefore may present as radiolucencies. The differential diagnosis in these instances includes dentiger- ous cyst, OKC/KCOT, and ameloblastoma. In later stages, when a mixed radiolucent-radiopaque appearance is present, a differential diagnosis would include adenomatoid odontogenic

• Figure 10-41 Calcifying odontogenic cyst showing calcification of ghost cells (upper left).
tumor, a partially mineralized odontoma, calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor, and ameloblastic fibro-odontoma.
Treatment and Prognosis
Because of the unpredictable biological behavior of this lesion, treatment is usually more aggressive than simple curettage. Patients should be monitored following treat- ment because recurrences are not uncommon. Management of the extraosseous or peripheral variant is conservative because recurrence is not characteristic.
Nonodontogenic Cysts
Globulomaxillary Cyst/Lesion
Globulomaxillary cysts were once considered fissural cysts, located between the globular and maxillary processes. The for- mer theory of origin involved epithelial entrapment within a line of embryologic closure with subsequent cystic change. Embryologic evidence now shows that the premaxilla and the maxillary processes do not fuse in this manner; thus there can be no fusion-related mechanism to account for a distinct globu- lomaxillary cyst in this location. Radiolucencies in this location, when reviewed microscopically, have been shown to represent radicular cysts, periapical granulomas, lateral periodontal cysts, OKCs, central giant cell granulomas, calcifying odontogenic cysts, and odontogenic myxomas. Presently, the term globulo- maxillary can be justified only in an anatomic sense, with definitive diagnosis of lesions located in this area made by combined clinical and microscopic examination (Box 10-10).
Radiologically, a globulomaxillary lesion appears as a well-defined radiolucency, often producing divergence of the roots of the maxillary lateral incisor and canine teeth. Radicular cyst and periapical granuloma can be ruled out with pulp vitality testing.
Because of the array of potential diagnoses, the histology varies considerably from case to case. Specific histologic features of the entities included in the differential diagnosis are found in the discussions of those entities.
Treatment and prognosis are determined by the defini- tive microscopic diagnosis.

Nasolabial Cyst
Nasolabial cysts are soft tissue cysts of the upper lip. The pathogenesis of the nasolabial cyst is unclear, although it has been suggested that this lesion represents cystic change in the solid cord remnants of cells that form the nasolacrimal duct.
The nasolabial cyst is a rare lesion with a peak incidence noted in the fourth and fifth decades. A distinct female predilection of nearly 4:1 has been noted. The chief clinical sign is a soft tissue swelling that may present in the soft tissue over the canine region or the mucobuccal fold.
The epithelial lining of this cyst is characteristically a pseudostratified columnar type with numerous goblet cells. Stratified squamous epithelium may be present in addition to cuboidal epithelium in some cases. The cyst is treated by curettage with few recurrences expected.
Median Mandibular Cyst
Median mandibular cysts, similar to globulomaxillary cysts, were once considered fissural cysts. Justification for a fissural origin was based on the no-longer-tenable theory of epithelial entrapment in the midline of the mandible during “fusion” of each half of the mandibular arch. Embryologic evidence suggests an isthmus of mesenchyme between the mandibular processes that is gradually elimi- nated as growth continues, and therefore no evidence of epithelial fusion. Cases diagnosed clinically as median mandibular cysts represent a microscopic spectrum of odontogenic cysts and tumors.
Nasopalatine Duct (Incisive Canal) Cyst
Nasopalatine duct cysts, also known as incisive canal cysts, are located within the nasopalatine canal or within the palatal soft tissues at the point of opening of the canal, where the lesions are called cysts of the palatine papilla. The so-called median palatine cyst is believed to represent a more posterior presentation of a nasopalatine duct cyst, rather than cystic degeneration of epithelial rests in the line of fusion of the palatine shelves.
Etiology and Pathogenesis
A nasopalatine duct cyst develops from the proliferation of epithelial remnants of paired embryonic nasopalatine ducts within the incisive canal. The canal itself is formed as a result of fusion of the premaxilla with the right and left palatal processes. The anatomic exit of the canal is slightly posterior to the incisive papilla.
The stimulus for cyst formation from the epithelial rem- nants of the nasopalatine canals is uncertain, although bacterial infection and/or trauma is thought to have a role. Alternatively, it has been suggested that mucous glands within the lining may cause cyst formation as a result of mucin secretion.
Clinical Features
This relatively common cyst may present as a symmetric swelling in the anterior region of the palatal midline or as a midline radiolucency (Figures 10-42 and 10-43; Box 10-11). Most cases occur between the fourth and sixth decades of life. Men are affected more often than women, with differences as great as 3:1.
Most cases are asymptomatic, with the clinical sign of swelling usually calling attention to the lesion. Symptoms

may follow secondary infection. Sinus formation and drain- age occur occasionally at the most prominent portion of the palatine papilla.
Radiographically, a nasopalatine duct cyst is purely radiolucent, with sharply defined margins. The lesion may produce divergence of the roots of the maxillary incisor teeth and, less commonly, may induce external root resorp- tion. The anterior nasal spine often is centrally superim- posed on the lucent defect, producing a heart shape. The radiolucency may occasionally be unilateral, with the mid- line forming the most medial aspect of the radiolucency.
Histopathology
The epithelial lining of this cyst ranges from stratified squa- mous to pseudostratified columnar (when located near the nasal cavity). In many instances, a mixture of two or more types of lining cells is seen. The connective tissue wall con- tains small arteries and nerves, representing the nasopala- tine neurovascular bundle (Figure 10-44).
Differential Diagnosis
The entities periapical granuloma and periapical (radicular) cyst must be separated from the nasopalatine duct (incisive canal) cyst. This is performed by determining tooth vitality. A normal but widened canal might also be considered.
Treatment and Prognosis
This cyst requires surgical enucleation. In cases of large cysts, marsupialization may be considered before definitive enucleation. The recurrence rate is very low.

CHAPTER 10 Cysts of the Jaws and Neck Pseudocysts
Aneurysmal Bone Cyst
Aneurysmal bone cysts are pseudocysts because they ap- pear radiographically as cyst-like lesions but microscopi- cally exhibit no epithelial lining (Box 10-12). This lesion represents a benign lesion of bone that may arise in the mandible, the maxilla, or other bones. Within the cranio- facial complex, approximately 40% of lesions are located in the mandible and 25% are located in the maxilla.
Etiology and Pathogenesis
The pathogenesis of the aneurysmal bone cyst is not well understood. Some evidence suggests a reactive process, and other evidence suggests a tumor. Supporting the tumor concept is the identification of translocation of the TRE17/ USP6 locus, resulting in TRE17 overexpression in more than 60% of ABC cases in long bones. An unrelated ante- cedent primary lesion of bone, such as fibrous dysplasia, central giant cell granuloma, nonossifying fibroma, chon- droblastoma, and other primary bone lesions, is believed to initiate a vascular malformation, resulting in a secondary lesion or aneurysmal bone cyst.
Clinical Features
Aneurysmal bone cysts typically occur in persons younger than 30 years. The peak incidence occurs within the second decade of life. A slight female predi- lection has been noted.
When the mandible and the maxilla are involved, the more posterior regions are affected, chiefly the molar areas (Figure 10-45). Pain is described in approximately half of cases, and a firm, nonpulsatile swelling is a common clinical sign. On auscultation, a bruit is not heard, indicating that blood is not located within an arterial space; on firm palpa- tion, crepitus may be noted.

Radiographic features include the presence of a destruc- tive or osteolytic process with slightly irregular margins. A multilocular pattern is noted in some instances. When the alveolar segment of the mandible and the maxilla is in- volved, teeth may be displaced with or without concomi- tant external root resorption.
Histopathology
A fibrous connective tissue stroma contains variable num- bers of multinucleated giant cells (Figure 10-46). Sinusoidal blood spaces are lined by fibroblasts and macrophages. With the exception of the sinusoids, the aneurysmal bone cyst is similar to central giant cell granuloma. Reactive new bone formation is commonly noted.
Differential Diagnosis
OKC/KCOT, central giant cell granuloma, and ameloblastic fibroma should be included in the differential diagnosis. Am- eloblastoma and odontogenic myxoma could be included, although these lesions more typically appear in older patients.
Treatment and Prognosis
A relatively high recurrence rate has been associated with simple curettage. Excision or curettage with supplemental cryotherapy is the treatment of choice.
• Figure 10-46 Aneurysmal bone cyst lining composed of connec- tive tissue and scattered multinucleated giant cells.
Traumatic (Simple) Bone Cyst
A traumatic bone cyst is an empty intrabony cavity that lacks an epithelial lining. The designation of pseudocyst relates to the cystic radiographic appearance and gross surgical presentation of this lesion (Box 10-13). It is seen most often in the mandible.
Pathogenesis
The pathogenesis is not known, although some cases seem to be associated with antecedent trauma. Assuming this to be the case, a traumatically-induced hematoma has been hypothesized as forming within the intramedullary portion of bone. Rather than organizing, the clot breaks down, leav- ing an empty bony cavity. Alternative developmental path- ways include cystic degeneration of primary tumors of bone, such as central giant cell granuloma, disorders of calcium metabolism, and ischemic necrosis of bone marrow.
Clinical Features
Teenagers are most commonly affected, although traumatic bone cysts have been reported over a wide age range. An equal gender distribution has been noted.
By far, the most common site of occurrence is the man- dible (Figure 10-47). The lesion may be seen in anterior or posterior regions. Rare bilateral cases have been described. Swelling is occasionally seen, and pain is infrequently noted.

Radiographically, a well-delineated area of radiolucency with an irregular but defined edge is noted. Inter-radicular scalloping of varying degrees is characteristic, and occasion- ally slight root resorption may be observed.
Traumatic bone cysts have often been seen in association with florid osseous dysplasia. The relationship between these two entities is not understood.
Histopathology
Grossly, only minimal amounts of fibrous tissue from the bony wall are seen. The lesion may occasionally contain blood or serosanguineous fluid. Microscopic examination should identify delicate, well-vascularized, fibrous connec- tive tissue without evidence of an epithelial component (Figure 10-48).
Treatment and Prognosis
Once entry into the cavity is accomplished, the clinician need merely establish bleeding into the lesion before clo- sure. Organization of the bony clot results in complete bony repair without recurrence.
Static Bone Cyst (Stafne’s Bone Defect)
A static bone cyst is an anatomic indentation of the posterior lingual mandible that appears to resemble a cyst on radio- graphic examination (Box 10-14; Figure 10-49). This depres- sion of the mandible is believed to be developmental, although almost all cases appear in adults, particularly men. The cause is unknown, but some have suggested that the lesion is due to entrapment of the salivary gland or other soft tissue during

development of the mandible. Others have suggested that the cause is lingual mandibular cortical erosion from hyperplastic salivary gland tissue. Both demographic and anatomic findings are more consistent with the latter hypothesis. These defects occasionally may be noted bilaterally and rarely, anterior to the first molar region of the mandible.
This lesion is entirely asymptomatic and is often ob- served as an incidental finding on panoramic radiographic films. It appears as a sharply circumscribed oval radiolu- cency beneath the level of the inferior alveolar canal, with encroachment on the inferior border of the mandible. The presence of salivary tissue within the defect may be con- firmed by sialography. The appearance of a static bone cyst is usually pathognomonic, and no treatment is required. Other depressions of the cortical surface of the mandible have been reported, albeit rarely, within the parotid gland along the lateral or facial aspect of the mandibular ramus.
Focal Osteoporotic Bone Marrow Defect
Focal osteoporotic bone marrow defects (hematopoietic bone marrow defects) are uncommon lesions that typically present as asymptomatic, focal radiolucencies in areas where hematopoiesis is normally seen (angle of the man- dible and maxillary tuberosity). Approximately 70% of these lesions occur in the posterior mandible; 70% occur in females.
The pathogenesis of the osteoporotic marrow defect is unknown, although three theories have been proposed. One theory states that abnormal healing following tooth extraction may be responsible (Figure 10-50). Another theory proposes that residual remnants of fetal marrow may persist into adulthood, thus presenting as a focal lucency. Finally, this tissue may merely represent a focus of extramedullary hematopoiesis that becomes hyperplastic in adult life.
Microscopic findings show a predominance of hemato- poietic cells with relatively fewer fat cells. Within the cel- lular marrow, small lymphoid aggregates may be found, as well as megakaryocytes (Figure 10-51).

Because of nonspecific radiographic findings, diagnosis by an incisional biopsy is generally desirable. Subsequent to the establishment of this diagnosis, no further treatment is necessary.
Soft Tissue Cysts of the Neck
Branchial Cyst/Cervical Lymphoepithelial Cyst
Branchial (cleft) cysts, or cervical lymphoepithelial cysts, are located in the lateral portion of the neck, usually anterior to the sternomastoid muscle (Figure 10-52). These lesions may also appear in the submandibular area, adjacent to the parotid gland, or around the sternomas- toid muscle. There is an intraoral lymphoepithelial cyst counterpart (Figure 10-53). The floor of the mouth is the most common site for these lesions, followed by the pos- terior lateral tongue.
At one time, the branchial cyst was thought to occur because of incomplete obliteration of the branchial

clefts, with epithelial remnants ultimately undergoing cystic change. The current theory of origin proposes that epithelium is entrapped in cervical lymph nodes during embryogenesis (Box 10-15). This epithelium, thought to be of salivary origin, would undergo cystic change at a later date.

Clinical Features
These asymptomatic cysts usually become clinically appar- ent in late childhood or young adulthood as a result of enlargement. Drainage may occur along the anterior mar- gin of the sternomastoid muscle.
Histopathology
The branchial cyst is lined with stratified squamous epi- thelium, pseudostratified columnar epithelium, or both (Figure 10-54). The epithelium is supported by connective tissue containing lymphoid aggregates.
Differential Diagnosis
Preoperative diagnoses may include cervical lymphadenitis, skin inclusion cyst, lymphangioma, and tumor of the tail of the parotid. Laterally displaced thyroglossal tract cyst and dermoid cyst might also be considered. In adults, metastatic oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, particularly cases associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, may present as a lateral neck mass. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the neck mass and advanced imaging are helpful in excluding this possibility.
Treatment
Treatment is surgical excision.

Designated as teratoma if all three germ layers are represented
the oral cavity, the lesion is usually in the anterior portion of the floor of the mouth in the midline. The cause of the lesion in this area is believed to be developmental entrap- ment of multipotential cells or possibly implantation of epithelium.
Clinical Features
Clinically, these cysts, when located above the mylohy- oid muscle, displace the tongue superiorly and posteri- orly (Figure 10-55). When they are located below the mylohyoid muscle, midline swelling of the neck occurs (Figure 10-56). These cysts are painless and slow grow- ing; no gender predilection has been noted. Lesions are generally smaller than 2 cm in diameter; however, extreme examples may range up to 8 to 12 cm. On palpation, the cysts are soft and doughy because of keratin and sebum in the lumen.
Histopathology
Microscopically, the dermoid cyst is lined by stratified squa- mous epithelium supported by a fibrous connective tissue

wall (Figure 10-57). Numerous secondary skin structures, including hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands (and occasionally teeth) may be found.
Treatment
Treatment is surgical excision. Most lesions can be removed through the mouth with little risk of recurrence.
Thyroglossal Tract Cyst
Thyroglossal tract cysts are the most common developmen- tal cysts of the neck, accounting for nearly three fourths of such lesions (Box 10-17). The basis of this cystic pathology relates to thyroid gland development. Thyroid tissue becomes evident in the fourth week of gestation, when derivatives of first and second branchial arches form the posterior portion of the tongue in the region of the foramen caecum. The thyroid anlage grows downward from the fora- men caecum area to its permanent location in the neck. Residual epithelial elements along this pathway that do not completely atrophy may give rise to cysts in later life from the posterior portion of the tongue (lingual thyroid) to the midline of the neck (Figures 10-58 and 10-59).
Clinical Features
Approximately 30% of cases are found in patients older than 30 years, with a similar percentage in patients younger than 10 years. Most cysts occur at the midline, with 60%

occurring in the thyrohyoid membrane and only 2% within the tongue itself. An overriding majority (70%-80%) occurs below the level of the hyoid bone, with most cysts being generally asymptomatic. When attached to the hyoid bone and tongue, they may retract on swallowing or on extension of the tongue. If infected, drainage through a sinus tract may occur. Rarely, malignant transformation has been described in these lesions.
Histopathology
Microscopic findings vary depending on the location of the cyst (Figure 10-60). Lesions that occur above the level of the hyoid bone demonstrate a lining chiefly of stratified squamous epithelium. A ciliated or columnar type of epithelium is usually found in cysts that occur below the hyoid bone. However, wide variation may be seen within a single cyst. Thyroid tissue may be present within the connective tissue wall. Rare malignancies aris- ing within the thyroglossal tract are usually papillary thyroid adenocarcinomas.

 •Figure10-60 Lingualthyroidshowingthyroidaciniinthesubmucosa.
Differential Diagnosis
Differential diagnosis of the thyroglossal tract cyst should include dermoid cyst, thyroid neoplasm, branchial cyst, and sebaceous cyst.
Treatment
Treatment is surgical excision. It is important to establish before surgery whether the thyroglossal duct cyst repre- sents the only functioning thyroid tissue in the patient. Because the lesion may be rather tortuous in configuration, recurrence may be seen. It is often recommended that the central portion of the hyoid bone be removed in an effort to eliminate any residual thyroglossal tract epithelium from this site.

  Odontogenic tumors are derived from the epithelial and/or mesenchymal remnants of the tooth-forming apparatus. Therefore, they are found exclusively in the mandible and maxilla (and occasionally in the gingiva). The origin and pathogenesis of this group of tumors are unknown. Clini- cally, odontogenic tumors are typically asymptomatic, although they may cause jaw expansion, movement of teeth, root resorption, and bone loss. Knowledge of typical basic features such as age, location, and radiographic appearance of the various odontogenic tumors can be extremely valuable in developing a clinical differential diagnosis.
Similar to neoplasms elsewhere in the body, odontogenic tumors tend to microscopically mimic the cell or tissue of origin. Histologically, odontogenic tumors may resemble soft tissue components of the enamel organ or dental pulp, or they may contain hard tissue elements of enamel, dentin, and/or cementum.
Biologically, lesions in this group range from hamartoma- tous proliferations to malignant neoplasms with metastatic capabilities. They may be found within the maxillofacial skeleton (central) or may be located in the soft tissue overly- ing the tooth-bearing regions and in the alveolar mucosa of edentulous segments of the jaws (peripheral). An under- standing of the biological behavior of the various odonto- genic tumors is fundamentally important to the overall treatment of patients.
Several classification schemes based on histologic pat- terns have been devised for this complex group of lesions. Common to all is the division of tumors into those com- posed of odontogenic epithelial elements, those composed of odontogenic mesenchyme, and those that are prolifera- tions of both epithelium and mesenchyme (ectomesen- chyme). As classified on the basis of biological behavior, they range from clinically trivial (i.e., benign, no recurrence potential) to malignant (Box 11-1).
Epithelial Tumors
Ameloblastoma
Historically, ameloblastoma has been recognized for over a century and a half. Its frequency, persistent local growth, and ability to produce marked deformity before leading to serious debilitation probably account for its early recogni- tion. Recurrence, especially after conservative treatment, has also contributed to awareness of this lesion.
Pathogenesis
This neoplasm originates within the mandible or maxilla from epithelium involved in the formation of teeth. Less commonly, the ameloblastoma may arise at a soft tissue loca- tion within the gingiva of tooth-bearing areas. Potential epi- thelial sources include the enamel organ, odontogenic rests (rests of Malassez, rests of Serres), reduced enamel epithe- lium, and the epithelial lining of odontogenic cysts, especially dentigerous cysts. The trigger or stimulus for neoplastic trans- formation of these epithelial residues is unknown.
Mechanisms by which ameloblastomas gain a growth and invasion advantage include those associated with tumorigen- esis and differentiation as well as other molecules related to tumor progression. These include, but are not limited to, overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),

Ameloblastomas, however, have a low proliferation rate, as shown by staining for the cell cycle–related protein, Ki-67. Mutations in the oncogenes BRAF (kinase signaling pathway) in mandibular tumors and SMO (hedgehog signaling pathway) in maxil- lary tumors have been discovered in a large proportion of ameloblastomas. Drugs developed to inhibit the mutated

proteins of these genes may have a role in the future treat- ment of ameloblastomas. Mutations of the p53 gene do not appear to play a role in the development and growth of am- eloblastoma; a role for ameloblastin protein has been identi- fied, although it is not specific to ameloblastoma.
Clinical Features
Ameloblastoma is chiefly a lesion of adults. It occurs pre- dominantly in the fourth and fifth decades of life, and the age range is very broad, extending from childhood to late adulthood (mean age, approximately 40 years) (Box 11-3). The rare lesions occurring in children are usually cystic and appear clinically as odontogenic cysts. There appears to be no gender predilection for this tumor.
Ameloblastomas may occur anywhere in the mandible or maxilla, although the mandibular molar-ramus area is the most common site. In the maxilla, the molar area is more commonly affected than the premolar and anterior regions. Lesions usually are asymptomatic and are discovered during routine radiographic examination or because of asymptom- atic jaw expansion (Figures 11-2 and 11-3). Occasionally,

tooth movement or malocclusion may be the initial pre- senting sign.
Radiographically, ameloblastomas are osteolytic, typi- cally found in the tooth-bearing areas of the jaws, and they may be unicystic or multicystic (Figures 11-4 to 11-7). Because ameloblastomas are slow growing, the radiographic margins usually are well defined and sclerotic. In cases in which connective tissue desmoplasia occurs in conjunction with tumor proliferation, ill-defined radiographic margins are typically seen. This variety, known as desmoplastic am- eloblastoma, also has a predilection for the anterior jaws and radiographically may resemble a fibro-osseous lesion. The generally slow tumor growth rate may be responsible for the movement of tooth roots. Root resorption occasion- ally occurs in association with ameloblastoma growth.
Biological Subtypes
Peripheral or extraosseous ameloblastomas may occur in the gingiva and very rarely in the buccal mucosa (Boxes 11-4 and 11-5; Figure 11-8). These lesions are seen in older adults, usually between 40 and 60 years of age. They may arise from overlying epithelium or rests of Serres. They exhibit a benign, nonaggressive course and generally do not invade underlying bone. Following local excision, recurrence is rare.
Cystic ameloblastoma (also referred to as unicystic ame- loblastoma) accounts for approximately 6% of ameloblasto- mas. We prefer the term cystic ameloblastoma, because these entities are often multilocular, show cortical perfora- tion in 25% of cases, and have a recurrence rate as high as 40% when treated by curettage (as late as 9 years following surgery) (Box 11-6; Figures 11-9 and 11-10). They are seen

Malignant variants of ameloblastomas may rarely be encountered. These lesions occur in a relatively young age group (thirties) and appear in the mandible more commonly than in the maxilla. By definition, these are lesions that metastasize to local lymph nodes or distant

attempts at primary tumor control. Regional lymph nodes are the second most common metastatic site, fol- lowed by the skull, liver, spleen, kidney, and skin.
The primary intraosseous carcinoma is an epithelial odontogenic malignancy of the mandible and maxilla that is believed to arise from odontogenic rests. This lesion does not have histologic features of ameloblastoma and is re- garded as a primary jaw carcinoma. It does not arise from a preexisting odontogenic cyst. This rare lesion of adults af- fects men more than women, and it is seen in the mandible more than the maxilla. Microscopically, about half of these lesions exhibit keratin formation, and about half show pe- ripheral palisading of epithelial cell nests. This lesion must be differentiated microscopically from acanthomatous am- eloblastoma and squamous odontogenic tumor. The prog- nosis is poor, with a 2-year survival rate reported at 40%.
Another ameloblastoma that might be considered a sub- type has been designated as sinonasal ameloblastoma, occur- ring mostly in men with a mean age of 61. Signs of nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and opacification are seen. The “totipo- tential” sinonasal lining cells are the putative cells of origin. A plexiform microscopic pattern is most commonly seen.
Histopathology
The numerous histologic patterns described for ameloblas- toma are of no clinical relevance (Box 11-7). Some may exhibit a single histologic subtype, and others may display several histologic patterns within the same lesion. Common to all subtypes is the palisading of columnar cells around epithelial nests in a pattern similar to that of ameloblasts of the enamel organ. Central to these cells are loosely arranged cells that mimic the stellate reticulum of the enamel organ (Figure 11-15). Another typical feature is the budding of tumor cells from neoplastic foci in a pattern reminiscent of tooth development.
The microscopic subtype most commonly seen in solid ameloblastoma is the follicular type (Figure 11-16). It is com- posed of islands of tumor cells that mimic the normal dental follicle. Central cystic degeneration of follicular islands leads to a microcystic pattern (Figure 11-17). Neoplastic cells

occasionally develop into a network of epithelium, prompt- ing the term plexiform ameloblastoma (Figure 11-18). When the stroma is desmoplastic and the tumor islands become squamous appearing (squamoid) or elongated, the term des- moplastic ameloblastoma is used (Figure 11-19). Some tu- mors are microscopically similar to basal cell carcinoma and are called basal cell or basaloid ameloblastomas. A type of solid ameloblastoma in which the central neoplastic cells ex- hibit prominent cytoplasmic granularity (and swelling) is known as granular cell ameloblastoma (Figure 11-20). Clear

tumor cells and cells expressing ghost cell–type keratinization have also been seen in ameloblastomas. Separation of amelo- blastomas into the various microscopic groups described is essentially an academic exercise, because there appears to be no correlation between clinical behavior and these micro- scopic patterns.
Cystic ameloblastoma is a type of ameloblastoma that is primarily cystic in appearance; it is composed of a thin

epithelial lining containing columnar basal cells with palisaded nuclei showing hyperchromasia and vacuolar change. Epi- thelial invagination into supporting connective tissue often occurs, and occasionally, mural islands may be seen. A charac- teristic spongiotic change is seen in the epithelial lining, and frequent subepithelial hyalinization (so-called Vickers-Gorlin effect) represents odontogenic ectomesenchyme induction. Some lesions have an intraluminal component, usually in a plexiform pattern. Diagnosis is often retrospective after enucle- ation for what was thought to be an odontogenic cyst.
Differential Diagnosis
When age, location, and radiographic features are consid- ered together, the clinical differential diagnosis generally can be limited to several entities in the three categories of jaw disease: odontogenic tumors, cysts, and benign non- odontogenic lesions. Among odontogenic tumors, the ra- diolucent form of the calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor and odontogenic myxomas are primary consider- ations. The dentigerous cyst and the odontogenic kerato- cyst can also be included. In relatively young individuals, lesions that are radiographically similar to ameloblastoma include nonodontogenic lesions such as central giant cell granuloma, ossifying fibroma, central hemangioma, and possibly idiopathic histiocytosis.

Odontogenic Tumors
Treatment and Prognosis
No single standard type of therapy can be advocated for pa- tients with ameloblastoma. Rather, each case should be judged on its own merits. Prime considerations are whether the lesion is solid, cystic, extraosseous, or malignant, and its location. Solid ameloblastoma requires at least surgical exci- sion, because recurrence follows curettage in 50% to 90% of cases. Block excision or resection followed by immediate surgical reconstruction generally is reserved for larger lesions. Cystic ameloblastomas may be treated less aggressively, but with the knowledge that recurrences are often associated with simple curettage. For cystic ameloblastoma, treatment op- tions can range from enucleation to resection, although recurrences are more likely if enucleated. Peripheral amelo- blastomas should be treated in a more conservative fashion. Malignant lesions should be managed as carcinomas. Patients with all forms of central ameloblastoma should be followed indefinitely because recurrences may be seen as long as 10 to 20 years after primary therapy. Ameloblastomas of the max- illa generally are more difficult to manage than those of the mandible because of anatomic relationships, as well as the comparatively higher content of cancellous bone compared with the mandible. Thus, intraosseous maxillary ameloblasto- mas are often excised with a wider normal margin than man- dibular tumors.
Radiotherapy has rarely been used in the treatment of ameloblastomas because it is generally believed that these tumors are radioresistant. Until more is known about tumor responsiveness, radiation should be reserved for exceptional cases that are difficult or impossible to control surgically.
Perhaps in the near future, targeted therapy aimed at mutated proteins, such as the V600E mutant protein of BRAF or SMO, will be developed and tested. The potential for tissue sparing molecular-based therapy is particularly exciting for this difficult neoplasm.
Calcifying Epithelial Odontogenic Tumor (Pindborg Tumor)
Calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor (CEOT), also known as Pindborg tumor, after the oral pathologist who first described the entity, is a benign tumor of odontogenic origin that shares many clinical features with ameloblas- toma (Box 11-8). Microscopically, however, there is no re- semblance to ameloblastoma, and radiographically distinct differences will often be noted. The cells from which these tumors are derived are unknown, although dental lamina remnants and the stratum intermedium of the enamel or- gan have been suggested.
Clinical Features
CEOTs are seen in patients ranging in age from the second to the tenth decade, with a mean age of about 40 years. There is no gender predilection. The mandible is affected twice as often as the maxilla, and a predilection for the molar-ramus region has been noted, although any site may be affected (Figure 11-21). Peripheral lesions, usually in the anterior gingiva, account for less than 5% of cases.

Jaw expansion or incidental observation on a routine radiographic survey is the usual way in which these lesions are discovered. Radiographically, the lesions are often asso- ciated with impacted teeth. The lesions may be unilocular or multilocular. Small loculations in some lesions have prompted use of the term honeycomb to describe this lucent pattern. A CEOT may be completely radiolucent, or it may contain opaque foci, a reflection of the calcified amyloid seen microscopically. The lesions are usually well circumscribed radiographically, although sclerotic margins may not always be evident.
Histopathology
The CEOT has a unique and sometimes bizarre micro- scopic pattern. Large polygonal epithelial cells, arranged in sheets or islands, contain nuclei that show considerable

variation in size and shape (Figure 11-22). Mitotic figures are rare. The cytoplasm is abundant and eosinophilic. Focal zones of clear cells occasionally can be seen in a so-called clear cell variant. Extracellular amyloid of epithelial origin is also typical of these tumors (Figures 11-23 and 11-24). This homogeneous, pale-staining eosinophilic material can be stained with Congo red or thioflavine T (Figure 11-25).
• Figure 11-22 Calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor composed of a sheet of atypical and multinucleated tumor epithelial cells.
• Figure 11-23 Calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor showing amyloid deposits.
• Figure 11-24 Calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor showing nuclear atypia, amyloid, and calcification.
Immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratins is also posi- tive, suggesting that keratin proteins form an important com- ponent of the amyloid in this tumor. Unique to the CEOT, this type of amyloid has been found to contain a 153-residue protein encoded by a specific gene (FLJ20513) of the odonto- genic ameloblast–associated protein locus. Concentric calcific deposits with a characteristic annular staining pattern (Liese- gang rings), seen in the amyloid material, are responsible for radiopacities when sufficiently dense. The incidental finding of Langerhans cells in CEOTs has been reported, but their significance in this setting is undetermined.
Differential Diagnosis
When this lesion is radiolucent, it must be separated clinically from dentigerous cyst, odontogenic keratocyst, ameloblas- toma, and odontogenic myxoma. Some benign nonodonto- genic jaw tumors might also be considered, but these would be less likely, on the basis of age and location.
When a mixed radiolucent-radiopaque pattern is encoun- tered, calcified odontogenic cyst should be considered in a clinical differential diagnosis. Other, less likely possibilities include adenomatoid odontogenic tumor, ameloblastic fi- bro-odontoma, ossifying fibroma, and osteoblastoma.
Treatment
This tumor has a locally infiltrative potential but apparently not to the same extent as ameloblastoma. It is slow growing and causes morbidity through direct tumor extension. Various forms of surgery, ranging from enucleation to resection, have been used to treat CEOTs. The overall recurrence rate has been less than 20%, indicating that aggressive surgery is not indi- cated for the management of most of these benign neoplasms. Very rare examples of malignant transformation of this tumor have been reported and are associated with loss of p53 tran- scriptional activity. Metastases have not been reported.
Adenomatoid Odontogenic Tumor
Adenomatoid odontogenic tumor (AOT) was formerly termed adenoameloblastoma because it was believed to be a subtype of ameloblastoma that contains ductlike or glandlike structures. Clinically, microscopically, and behav- iorally, it is clearly different from ameloblastoma, and the term adenoameloblastoma is not used (Box 11-9).
Clinical Features
AOTs are seen in a rather narrow age range, between 5 and 30 years, with most cases appearing in the second decade. Females are more commonly affected than males. Lesions of- ten appear in the anterior portion of the jaws, more often in the anterior maxilla, generally in association with the crowns of impacted teeth (Figure 11-26). Three variants of this tumor have been identified: follicular (73% of cases), extrafollicular (24%), and peripheral (3%). AOT is rarely seen in association with other benign odontogenic tumors and cysts.
Radiographically, the follicular AOT is a well-circum- scribed unilocular lesion that usually appears around the crown of an impacted tooth; the extrafollicular type usually

presents as a well-defined unilocular radiolucency above, be- tween, or superimposed over the roots of an unerupted tooth. Lesions typically are radiolucent but may have small opaque foci distributed throughout, reflecting the presence of calcifi- cations in the tumor tissue (Figure 11-27) (Box 11-10). When they are located between anterior teeth, divergence of roots may be seen. The peripheral type is characterized by a painless, nontender gingival swelling.

Histopathology
An intracystic epithelial proliferation is composed of poly- hedral to spindle cells. The pattern typically is lobular, although some areas may show a syncytial arrangement of cells. Rosettes and ductlike structures of columnar epithelial cells give the lesion its characteristic microscopic features (Figures 11-28 and 11-29). Foci of periodic acid–Schiff (PAS)-positive material are scattered throughout the lesion. The number, size, and degree of calcification of these foci determine how the lesion presents radiographically.
Differential Diagnosis
Other lesions that might be included in a differential diag- nosis of AOT are dentigerous cyst (because of frequent as- sociation with impacted teeth) and lateral periodontal cyst (because of its occasional location adjacent to roots of ante- rior teeth). If opacities are evident, calcifying odontogenic cyst and CEOT should receive consideration.
Treatment
Conservative treatment (enucleation) is all that is required. AOTs are benign, encapsulated lesions that do not recur.
• Figure 11-29 Adenomatoid odontogenic tumor exhibiting pseu- doducts and rosettes.
Squamous Odontogenic Tumor
Because squamous odontogenic tumor involves the alveolar process, the lesion is believed to be derived from neoplastic transformation of the rests of Malassez. It occurs in the mandible and the maxilla with equal frequency, favoring the anterior region of the maxilla and the posterior region of the mandible. Multiple lesions have been described in about 20% of affected patients, as have familial multicen- tric lesions.
The age range for this tumor extends from the second through seventh decades, with a mean age of 40 years. There is no gender predilection. Patients usually experience no symptoms, although tenderness and tooth mobility have been reported. Radiographically, this lesion typically is a well circumscribed, often semilunar lesion associated with the cervical region of roots of teeth. Microscopically, it has some similarity to ameloblastoma, although it lacks the columnar peripherally palisaded layer of epithelial cells (Figure 11-30). Although proliferation is robust, some similarity to proliferating odontogenic rests has been noted.
Squamous odontogenic tumors have some invasive capacity and infrequently recur after conservative therapy. Curettage or excision is the treatment of choice.
Clear Cell Odontogenic Tumor (Carcinoma)
Clear cell odontogenic tumor (carcinoma) is a rare neo- plasm of the mandible and maxilla (Box 11-11). The origin is unknown, but the location and histologic appearance of this lesion suggest an odontogenic source. Usually found in women older than 60 years, it is a locally aggressive, poorly circumscribed neoplasm composed of sheets of cells with relatively clear cytoplasm (Figure 11-31). The rate of recur- rence may be as high as 50%. Metastases to lung and to regional lymph nodes have been reported. The microscopic differential diagnosis includes other jaw tumors that may have a clear cell component, such as CEOT, central muco- epidermoid carcinoma, metastatic acinic cell carcinoma, met- astatic renal cell carcinoma, hyalinizing clear cell carcinoma, and ameloblastoma. Stains often need to be performed to rule out other local clear cell carcinomas that produce mucin or

Keratocystic Odontogenic Tumor (See Odontogenic Keratocyst/Keratocystic Odontogenic Tumor in Chapter 10)
Dentinogenic Ghost Cell Tumor (Formerly Calcifying Odontogenic Cyst)
Calcifying odontogenic cyst (COC) refers to a category of lesions that occurs in three forms: as a cyst (also called calci- fying cystic odontogenic tumor and described in Chapter 10), as a locally infiltrative benign neoplasm referred to as dentinogenic ghost cell tumor, and a very rare malignant variant termed dentinogenic ghost cell carcinoma. The dis- tinctive feature of all these forms is of an ameloblastomatous epithelium containing “ghost cells” within the epithelial com- ponent. Ghost cells are relatively large, eosinophilic cells that contain the outline of a nucleus centrally and represent aber- rant keratinization. The keratin may undergo dystrophic calcification and may cause a foreign body reaction in the

wall. Ghost cells are not unique to the dentinogenic ghost cell tumor and can occasionally be seen associated with other odontogenic tumors including odontomas and ameloblastomas. Dentin formation is also seen in the den- tinogenic ghost cell tumor as masses of hard tissue within the wall and associated with the epithelial component. Radiographically the dentinogenic ghost cell tumor is cir- cumscribed with a mixed lucent and opaque quality. The benign tumor may be locally infiltrative and as such is treated by local resection especially if the margins are poorly defined radiographically. The extraosseous variant is treated by enucleation. The rare malignant variant is man- aged in a similar manner to other intraosseous carcinomas.
Mesenchymal Tumors
Odontogenic Myxoma
Odontogenic myxoma is a benign mesenchymal lesion that mimics microscopically the dental pulp or follicular con- nective tissue. It is a relatively common odontogenic tu- mor, representing 1% to 17% of all tumor types. Although myxomas are noted at various sites of the body, including the dermis, heart (left atrium), and other head and neck sites, only odontogenic myxoma of the jaws is derived
   
www.konkur.in
from odontogenic ectomesenchyme. This benign neoplasm is infiltrative and may recur after inadequate treatment (Box 11-12).
Clinical Features
The age range in which this lesion appears extends from 10 to 50 years, with a mean of about 30 years. There is no gender predilection, and the lesions are seen anywhere in the mandible and maxilla with about equal frequency (Figure 11-32).
Radiographically, this lesion is always lucent, although the pattern may be quite variable. It may appear as a

Histopathology
This tumor is composed of bland, relatively acellular myxo- matous connective tissue (Figure 11-34). Benign fibroblasts and myofibroblasts with variable amounts of collagen are found in a mucopolysaccharide matrix. Bony islands, repre- senting residual trabeculae, and capillaries are found scat- tered throughout the lesion (Figure 11-35). Odontogenic rests typically are absent in these tumors and are not re- quired for the diagnosis. Odontogenic myxomas have a very low proliferation rate. However, they express some anti- apoptotic proteins, which, in part, may explain their persis- tence. Myxomatous follicular sacs with odontogenic rests should not be confused with this neoplasm (Figure 11-36). When relatively large amounts of collagen are evident, the term odontogenic fibromyxoma may be used.
Differential Diagnosis
The clinical differential diagnosis is essentially the same as that described for ameloblastoma. In addition, central hemangioma is a serious consideration for a lesion with a honeycomb radiographic appearance. An important note is that the microscopic differential diagnosis should include developing dental pulp and hyperplastic follicular connec- tive tissue surrounding a developing or mature impacted tooth. Nerve sheath myxoma might be considered, al- though this entity is rare in the jaws. Odontogenic myxo- mas do not express neural proteins. Clinical pathologic correlation is important in the definitive diagnosis of odontogenic myxoma.

Treatment
Surgical excision (conservative to radical) is the treatment of choice. However, because of its loose, gelatinous consis- tency and absence of a capsule, recurrence is more likely if the lesion is treated too conservatively. Although these lesions exhibit some aggressiveness and have a moderate recurrence rate, the prognosis is very good. Repeated surgi- cal procedures do not appear to stimulate growth or metas- tasis. Follow-up examinations should be performed for a minimum of 5 years.
Central Odontogenic Fibroma
Central odontogenic fibroma is a rare ectomesenchymal tumor that is regarded as the central counterpart to periph- eral odontogenic fibroma (Box 11-13). It has been seen in all age groups and is found in both the mandible and the maxilla, with a 2:1 female predilection (Figure 11-37). It results in a radiolucent lesion that usually is multilocular, often causing cortical expansion. Approximately 45% of

cases occur anterior to the first molar region of the maxilla, often with a cortical bony depression of the palatal contour. The clinical differential diagnosis is similar to that described for ameloblastoma.
Microscopically, two patterns generally are ascribed to central odontogenic fibroma (Figure 11-38). In the simple or epithelium-poor type, the lesion is composed of a mass of mature fibrous tissues containing few epithelial rests. In the complex (World Health Organization [WHO]) type, mature connective tissue contains an abundant odonto- genic epithelial component in the form of rests, along with calcified deposits of what is regarded as dentin or cemen- tum. This microscopic differentiation may be academic, in that there appears to be no difference in clinical behavior between the two subtypes. A microscopic differential diag- nosis would include desmoplastic fibroma (the bony coun- terpart of fibromatosis). This purely fibrous connective tis- sue lesion may be difficult to separate from central odontogenic fibroma because of overlapping microscopy. Clinical correlation should help because desmoplastic fibroma would exhibit a more aggressive and recurrent behavior. The tumor has been reported to be associated with giant cell granuloma–like lesions. Treatment of odon- togenic fibroma is enucleation or excision, and recurrence is

very uncommon. An exception in terms of recurrence potential is the odontogenic fibroma with a central giant cell lesion component, in which a 23% rate of recurrence has been reported.
Cementifying Fibroma
See discussion of ossifying fibroma in Chapter 12.
Cementoblastoma
Clinical Features
Cementoblastoma, also known as true cementoma, is a rare benign neoplasm of cementoblasts that microscopically re- sembles an osteoblastoma but is connected or fused to the root of a tooth (Box 11-14). It occurs predominantly in the second and third decades of life, typically before 25 years of age. There is no gender predilection. It is seen more often in the mandible than in the maxilla and more often in posterior than in anterior regions. It is intimately associated with the root of a tooth, and the tooth remains vital. Cementoblas- toma may cause cortical expansion and, occasionally, low- grade intermittent pain.
Radiographically, this neoplasm is an opaque lesion that replaces the root of the tooth (Figure 11-39). It usually is surrounded by a thick uniform radiolucent ring that is con- tiguous with the periodontal ligament space and the ad- vancing front of the tumor.

Odontogenic Tumors
Histopathology
This lesion appears microscopically as a dense mass of mineral- ized cementum-like material with numerous reversal lines (Figure 11-40). Intervening well-vascularized soft tissue con- tains cementoblasts, often numerous, large, and hyperchro- matic. The histologic features are similar if not identical to those of an osteoblastoma but with attachment to a tooth root.
Differential Diagnosis
The characteristic radiographic appearance of this lesion is usually diagnostic. Other opaque lesions that share some features include odontoma, osteoblastoma, focal sclerosing osteomyelitis, and hypercementosis.
Treatment
Because of the intimate association of this neoplasm with the tooth root, it cannot be removed without sacrificing the tooth by way of a surgical extraction procedure. Bone relief typically is required to remove this well-circumscribed mass. Recurrence is not seen.
Periapical Cemento-osseous Dysplasia
As the name implies, periapical cemento-osseous dysplasia represents a reactive or dysplastic process, rather than a neo- plastic one. This lesion appears to be an unusual response of periapical bone and cementum to some undetermined local factor (Box 11-15). Populations most at risk include East Asians and those of African origin. When not associated with a tooth apex, the term focal cemento-osseous dysplasia is used.
Clinical Features
This relatively common phenomenon occurs at the apex of vital teeth. A biopsy is unnecessary because the condition is usually diagnostic by clinical and radiographic features. Women, especially black women, are affected more than men. Periapical cemento-osseous dysplasia appears in middle age (;40 years) and rarely before the age of 20. The mandible, especially the anterior periapical region, is far more commonly affected than other areas. Often, the apices of two or more teeth are affected.

This condition typically is discovered on routine radio- graphic examination because patients are asymptomatic. It appears first as a periapical lucency that is continuous with the periodontal ligament space. Although this initial pattern simulates radiographically a periapical granuloma or cyst, the teeth are always vital. As the condition progresses or matures, the lucent lesion develops into a mixed or mottled pattern because of bone repair. In its final stage, the tumor appears as a solid, opaque mass that is often surrounded by a thin, lucent ring. This process takes months to years to reach the final stages of development and, obviously, may be discovered at any stage (Figures 11-41 to 11-43).

A related but less common condition is known as florid cemento-osseous dysplasia (FCOD) (Box 11-16; Figures 11-44 and 11-45). No cause is apparent and patients are asymptomatic, except when the complication of osteomy- elitis occurs. Women, especially black women, are pre- dominantly affected, usually between 25 and 60 years of age. The condition typically is bilateral and may affect all four quadrants. A curious finding has been the concomitant appearance of traumatic (simple) bone cysts in affected tis- sue. Radiographically, FCOD appears as diffuse radiopaque

irregular masses. Reversal lines eventually are seen, and osteoblasts, cementoblasts, or both, line the islands of hard tissue. Chronic inflammatory cells may also be seen. Microscopically, periapical cemento-osseous dysplasia may appear very similar to chronic osteomyelitis and ossifying fibroma.
Microscopically, FCOD is a heterogeneous lesion con- sisting of a benign fibrous stroma that contains irregular trabeculae of mature and immature bone and cementum- like material (Figure 11-47). Because FCOD is an asymp- tomatic, self-limited process, no treatment is required. In cases in which secondary infection occurs, antibiotics and sequestrectomy may be necessary.
Differential Diagnosis
Age, gender, location, radiographic appearance, and tooth vitality considered together are considered to diag- nose this condition. When one or more of these factors are atypical, diagnostic considerations include chronic osteomyelitis, ossifying fibroma, and periapical granu- loma or cyst. In the opaque stage, odontoma, osteoblas- toma, and focal sclerosing osteomyelitis are diagnostic possibilities.
The clinical differential diagnosis of FCOD includes diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis, Paget’s disease, and famil- ial gigantiform cementoma. Paget’s disease can be ruled out with biopsy and determination of serum alkaline phosphatase (elevated in Paget’s disease, normal in FCOD). Chronic diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis would be symptomatic and would have a different radiographic appearance. Also, inflammatory cells would be evident in biopsy tissue.
Treatment
No treatment is required for periapical cemento-osseous dysplasia or FCOD. Once the opaque stage is reached, the lesion usually stabilizes and causes no complications. Because teeth remain vital throughout the entire process, they should not be extracted, and endodontic procedures should not be performed.
• Figure 11-47 Florid cemento-osseous dysplasia. This lesion has a heterogeneous benign fibro-osseous appearance.
Mixed (Epithelial and Mesenchymal) Tumors
Ameloblastic Fibroma and Ameloblastic Fibro-odontoma
Ameloblastic fibroma and ameloblastic fibro-odontoma are considered together because they appear to be slight varia- tions of the same benign neoplastic process (Box 11-17). Except for the presence of an odontoma, people afflicted with either of these two lesions share similar features of age, gender, and location. The biological behaviors of these le- sions are also similar. Both are benign mixed odontogenic tumors composed of neoplastic epithelium and mesenchyme with microscopically identical soft tissue components.
Clinical Features
These neoplasms occur predominantly in children and young adults. The mean age is about 12 years, and the upper age limit is around 40 years. The mandibular molar-ramus area is the favored location for these lesions, although they may appear in any region. There is no gender predilection.
Radiographically, these lesions are well circumscribed and usually are surrounded by a sclerotic margin (Figures 11-48 and 11-49). They may be unilocular or multilocular and may be associated with the crown of an impacted tooth. An opaque focus that appears within the ameloblastic fibro- odontoma is due to the presence of an odontoma. This lesion

therefore appears as a combined lucent-opaque lesion; the ameloblastic fibroma is completely lucent radiographically.
Histopathology
These lesions are lobulated in general configuration and usually are surrounded by a fibrous capsule. The tumor mass is composed predominantly of primitive-appearing myxoid connective tissue (Figures 11-50 and 11-51). The general absence of collagen gives this component a resem- blance to dental pulp. Evenly distributed throughout the tumor mesenchyme are ribbons or strands of odontogenic epithelium that typically are two cells wide. Rarely, the epithelium may be more follicular in appearance, resem- bling ameloblastoma. The epithelial component has been compared microscopically to the dental lamina that prolif- erates from oral epithelium in the early stages of tooth development.
In ameloblastic fibro-odontoma, one or more foci con- tain enamel and dentin. This may be seen in the form of a compound or complex odontoma, the presence of which does not alter treatment or prognosis (Figure 11-52).
• Figure 11-50 Ameloblastic fibroma composed of pale myxoid stroma with numerous strands of odontogenic epithelium.
Differential Diagnosis
When ameloblastic fibroma (fibro-odontoma) presents with the clinical features (age, location) and radiographic pattern that are typical for these lesions, the diagnosis is usually ap- parent. When clinical features are outside the usual bound- aries, differential diagnosis for ameloblastic fibroma should include ameloblastoma, odontogenic myxoma, dentigerous cyst, odontogenic keratocyst, central giant cell granuloma, and histiocytosis. The differential diagnosis for ameloblastic fibro-odontoma includes lesions with mixed radiographic patterns such as calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor, calcifying odontogenic cyst, developing odontoma, and pos- sibly AOT. Microscopically, this lesion must be differenti- ated from hyperplastic follicular sacs, in which proliferation of odontogenic rests is seen.
Treatment
Because of tumor encapsulation and the general lack of in- vasive capacity, this lesion is treated through a conservative surgical procedure such as curettage or excision. Recur- rences have been documented, but they are uncommon.

Odontogenic Tumors
 • Figure 11-52 Ameloblastic fibro-odontoma. Note odontoma at right.
A rare malignant counterpart known as ameloblastic fibrosarcoma has been documented as arising in the jaws de novo or from preexisting or recurrent ameloblastic fibroma (Figure 11-53). In this lesion, the mesenchymal component has the appearance of a fibrosarcoma, and the epithelial component appears as it does in the benign lesion. Clini- cally, ameloblastic fibrosarcoma occurs at about 30 years of age and more often in the mandible than in the maxilla. Symptoms of pain and paresthesia may be present. This lo- cally aggressive lesion has metastatic potential. Resection is therefore the treatment of choice.
Odontoma
Odontomas are mixed odontogenic tumors, in that they are composed of both epithelial and mesenchymal dental hard tissues. These fully differentiated tissues are a composite of enamel and dentin. Biologically, odontomas can be re- garded as hamartomas rather than neoplasms.
These calcified lesions take one of two general configura- tions. They may appear as numerous miniature or rudimen- tary teeth, in which case they are known as compound odon- tomas, or they may appear as amorphous conglomerations of hard tissue, in which case they are known as complex odonto- mas. They are the most common odontogenic tumors.
• Figure 11-53 Ameloblastic fibrosarcoma with a malignant mesen- chymal component.
Clinical Features
Odontomas are lesions of children and young adults; most are discovered in the second decade of life (Box 11-18). The range does, however, extend into later adulthood. The max- illa is affected slightly more often than the mandible. There is also a tendency for compound odontomas to occur in the anterior jaws, and for complex odontomas to occur in the posterior jaws. There does not appear to be a significant gender predilection. Clinical signs suggestive of an odon- toma include a retained deciduous tooth, an impacted tooth, and alveolar swelling (Figure 11-54). These lesions generally produce no symptoms.
Radiographically, compound odontomas typically ap- pear as numerous tiny teeth in a single focus. This focus is typically found in a tooth-bearing area, between roots or over the crown of an impacted tooth. Complex odontomas appear in the same regions, but as amorphous, opaque masses (Figures 11-55 and 11-56). Lesions discovered during early stages of tumor development are primarily radiolucent, with focal areas of opacity representing early calcification of dentin and enamel.
Histopathology
Normal appearing enamel, dentin, cementum, and pulp may be seen in these lesions. A prominent enamel matrix and the associated enamel organ are often seen before final maturation of hard tissues (Figure 11-57). So-called ghost cell keratinization is seen occasionally in the enamel-forming cells of some odontomas. This microscopic feature has no significance other than to indicate the potential of these epi- thelial cells to keratinize.
Differential Diagnosis
Compound odontomas are diagnostic on radiographic ex- amination. Complex odontomas usually present a typical radiographic appearance because of their solid opacification in relationship to teeth. However, a differential diagnosis might include other opaque jaw lesions such as focal scleros- ing osteitis, osteoma, periapical cemental dysplasia, ossifying fibroma, and cementoblastoma.

Treatment
Odontomas have very limited growth potential, although an occasional complex odontoma may achieve consider- able mass. Enucleation is curative, and recurrence is not a problem.
A rare variant known as odontoameloblastoma has been described. This is essentially an ameloblastoma in which there is focal differentiation into an odontoma. Until more is known of the behavior of this rare lesion, it should be treated as an ameloblastoma.

Ossifying Fibroma
Ossifying fibroma is a benign neoplasm that can occur in any facial bone and has the potential for excessive growth, bone destruction, and recurrence. It is clinically and micro- scopically similar, if not identical, to cementifying fibroma, and is noted to occur in the mandible more commonly than in other facial bones. Composed of a fibrous connective tissue stroma in which new bone is formed, it is classified as one of the benign fibro-osseous lesions of the jaws (Boxes 12-1 and 12-2).
Etiology and Pathogenesis
Ossifying fibroma is of undetermined cause (Box 12-3). Although chromosome translocations have been identified in a few cases of ossifying fibroma, genetic studies have been insufficient to determine the molecular mechanisms that underlie the development of this tumor.

Clinical Features
Ossifying fibroma is an uncommon lesion that tends to oc- cur during the third and fourth decades of life, and in women more commonly than men. It is a generally slow- growing, asymptomatic, and expansile lesion. In the head and neck, ossifying fibroma may be seen in the jaws, cranio- facial bones, and anterior cranial fossa. Uncommonly, rapid growth may be seen in children (juvenile ossifying fibroma). Lesions of the jaws characteristically arise in the tooth- bearing regions, most often in the mandibular premolar- molar area (Figure 12-1). When involving the sinonasal structures, large bulbous lesions may extend into the nasal or sinus cavity. The slow but persistent growth of the tumor within the jaws may ultimately produce expansion and thinning of the buccal and lingual cortical plates, although perforation and mucosal ulceration are rare (Figures 12-2 and 12-3). Most of these lesions are solitary, although in- stances of multiple synchronous lesions have been reported; a familial background for synchronous lesions is rare.
The most important radiographic feature of this lesion is the well-circumscribed, sharply defined border, with a generally expansile profile. Ossifying fibromas otherwise

present a variable appearance, depending on the density of calcifications present. Lesions may be relatively radiolucent because of evenly dispersed, calcified new bone. Lesions may also appear as unilocular or multilocular radiolucen- cies that bear a resemblance to odontogenic lesions. A mixed radiolucent-radiopaque image is seen when islands of tumor bone are densely calcified. The roots of teeth may be displaced; less commonly, tooth resorption is seen.
The term juvenile (aggressive) ossifying fibroma was used in the literature to describe two variants of ossifying fibroma that occur in younger patients (Box 12-4). Cur- rently these two entities are referred to as juvenile trabecular ossifying fibroma (JTOF) and juvenile psammomatoid ossifying fibroma (JPOF). Juvenile trabecular ossifying fibroma (JTOF) typically occurs in children and adoles- cents; only about 20% of cases occur in those older than 15 years. The lesion occurs almost exclusively in the maxilla and mandible and rarely in extragnathic locations. JTOF is characterized by progressive and sometimes rapid growth but rarely pain. Radiographically, the tumor has a defined border and can range from radiodense to radiolucent. Microscopically, JTOF is highly cellular and contains tra- beculae or spheroids of new bone. Following complete excision, recurrences of JTOF are infrequent. By contrast, the juvenile psammomatoid ossifying fibroma (JPOF) occurs principally in the extragnathic craniofacial bones,

particularly the paranasal sinuses and periorbital bones, where it may cause exophthalmos, proptosis, sinusitis, and nasal symptoms. JPOF occurs in a slightly older population compared with JTOF. Microscopically, JPOF is formed by relatively cellular stroma containing small, rounded calcifi- cations (psammomatoid). Treatment consists of surgical excision, but up to 30% of cases will show recurrences, sometimes multiple and over a span of many years.
Cementifying fibroma and cemento-ossifying fibroma are terms occasionally used when the bony islands in these jaw tumors are round or spheroidal. These occur in similar age groups and locations, exhibit comparable clinical char- acteristics, and have the same biological behavior. They are, for all practical purposes, the same lesions as ossifying fi- broma, with recent classification schemes merging these entities under ossifying fibroma.
Histopathology
Ossifying fibroma is composed of fibrous connective tissue with well-differentiated spindled fibroblasts. Cellularity is uniform but may vary from one lesion to the next. Collagen fibers are arranged haphazardly, although a whorled, stori- form pattern may be evident. Bony spheroids, trabeculae, or islands are evenly distributed throughout the fibrous stroma (Figures 12-4 to 12-6). In variants of this tumor, where trabecular or psammomatoid mineralized islands dominate, the terms juvenile or psammomatoid ossifying fibroma have been used respectively. Bone is immature and often is surrounded by osteoblasts. Osteoclasts are infre- quently seen.
Differential Diagnosis
Distinguishing between ossifying fibroma and fibrous dys- plasia is the primary diagnostic challenge. These lesions may exhibit similar clinical, radiographic, and microscopic fea- tures. The most helpful clinical feature in distinguishing the two is the well-circumscribed radiographic appearance of ossifying fibroma and the ease with which it can be sepa- rated from normal bone. In most cases, the well-defined appearance of ossifying fibroma is evident radiographically.

• Figure 12-5 Ossifying fibroma with cellular stroma and small bony islands.
• Figure 12-6 Ossifying fibroma composed of bony trabeculae in benign fibroblast matrix.
Historically, differentiating the two lesions was based pri- marily on histologic criteria. Molecular analysis has shown that ossifying fibroma does not contain the mutation in GNAS 1a. Fibrous dysplasia was reported to contain only woven bone, without evidence of osteoblastic rimming of bone. The presence of more mature lamellar bone was believed to be characteristic of ossifying fibroma. Most
authorities now acknowledge that these criteria are unreli- able, because both types of bone and cellular features may be found in either lesion.
Other differential considerations are osteoblastoma, focal cemento-osseous dysplasia, and focal osteomyelitis. Osteo- blastoma is evident in a slightly younger age group and is often characterized by pain. In addition, osseous trabeculae in these lesions are rimmed by abundant plump osteoblasts, and a central nidus may be evident. Periapical cemento- osseous dysplasia in posterior teeth may appear radiographi- cally similar and may require a biopsy to separate it from ossifying fibroma. Focal osteomyelitis is associated with a source of inflammation and may be accompanied by pain and swelling.
Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment of ossifying fibroma is most often accomplished by surgical removal using curettage or enucleation. In cases where there is aggressive behavior marked by rapid growth and enlargement, resection may be necessary. The lesion is typically separated easily from the surrounding normal bone. Recurrence is described only rarely after removal.
Fibrous Dysplasia
Fibrous dysplasia is a condition in which normal medullary bone is replaced by an abnormal fibrous connective tissue proliferation in which new, nonmaturing bone is formed (Box 12-5).
Etiology and Pathogenesis
The name given to fibrous dysplasia was originally intended to indicate that the condition represented a dysplastic growth resulting from deranged mesenchymal cell activity

or a defect in the control of bone cell activity. Genetic stud- ies, however, have provided evidence that it may be better classified as a neoplastic process. Mutations of the GNAS I gene encoding for the alpha subunit of a transmembrane- signaling G protein (Gsa) appear to be present in fibrous dysplasia. The mutation within the GNAS gene has been demonstrated in 86% of cases, where specific mutations at exons 8 and 9 are present.
This genetic alteration may ultimately affect the prolif- eration and differentiation of fibroblasts/osteoblasts that make up these lesions.
Clinical Features
This disease most commonly presents as an asymptomatic, slow enlargement of involved bone. Fibrous dysplasia may involve a single bone or several bones concomitantly. Monostotic fibrous dysplasia is the designation used to describe the process in one bone. Polyostotic fibrous dys- plasia applies to cases in which more than one bone is in- volved. McCune-Albright syndrome consists of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, cutaneous melanotic pigmentations (café-au-lait macules), and endocrine abnormalities, spe- cifically premature pubertal development (2.5-3 standard deviations earlier than the average age). The most com- monly reported endocrine disorder consists of precocious sexual development in girls. Acromegaly, hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, and hyperprolactinemia have also been described. Jaffe-Lichtenstein syndrome is character- ized by multiple bone lesions of fibrous dysplasia and skin pigmentations.
Monostotic fibrous dysplasia is much more common than the polyostotic form, accounting for as many as 80% of cases. Jaw involvement is common in this form of the disease. Other bones that are commonly affected are the ribs and the femur. Fibrous dysplasia occurs more often in the maxilla than in the mandible (Figure 12-7). Maxillary lesions may extend to involve the maxillary sinus, zygoma, sphenoid bone, and floor of the orbit. This form of the disease, with involvement of several adjacent bones, has been referred to as craniofacial fibrous dysplasia. The most
common site of occurrence with mandibular involvement is in the body portion.
The slow, progressive enlargement of the affected jaw is usually painless and typically presents as a unilateral swell- ing. As the lesion grows, facial asymmetry becomes evident and may be the initial presenting complaint. The dental arch is generally maintained, although displacement of teeth, malocclusion, and interference with tooth eruption may occasionally occur. Tooth mobility is not seen.
This condition characteristically has its onset during the first or second decade of life. Rarely, the lesion presents later in life, although this may only reflect the insidious, asymptomatic nature of fibrous dysplasia. Monostotic fibrous dysplasia generally exhibits an equal gender distri- bution; the polyostotic form tends to occur more com- monly in females.
Fibrous dysplasia has a variable radiographic appearance that ranges from a radiolucent lesion to a uniformly radi- opaque mass (Figures 12-8 to 12-10). The classic lesion has been described as having a radiopaque change that imparts a “ground-glass” or “peau d’orange” effect. This characteris- tic image, which is identifiable on intraoral radiographs, is not pathognomonic. Lesions of fibrous dysplasia may also present as unilocular or multilocular radiolucencies, espe- cially in long bones. A third pattern, most commonly seen in patients with long-standing disease, is a mottled radiolu- cent and radiopaque appearance. Additional radiographic features that have been described include a fingerprint bone pattern and superior displacement of the mandibular canal in mandibular lesions.
An important distinguishing feature of fibrous dysplasia is the poorly defined radiographic and clinical margins of the lesion. The process appears to blend into the surround- ing normal bone without evidence of a circumscribed bor- der. In addition, these lesions are often elliptic as opposed to spherical.
Laboratory values for patients with monostotic fibrous dysplasia, specifically, serum calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase, are usually within normal ranges for patients with monostotic disease. However, these serum

Histopathology
Fibrous dysplasia consists of a slightly to moderately cellular fibrous connective tissue stroma that contains foci of irregu- larly shaped trabeculae of immature bone (Figures 12-11 and 12-12). A relatively constant ratio of fibrous tissue to bone throughout a given lesion is characteristic. The

• Figure 12-12 Fibrous dysplasia showing vascular fibroblastic matrix and irregular trabeculae of new bone.
fibroblasts exhibit uniform spindle-shaped nuclei, and mi- totic figures are not seen. The bony trabeculae assume irregu- lar shapes likened to Chinese characters (the pictograms used in Chinese writing), and they do not display any functional orientation. The bone is predominantly woven in type and appears to arise directly from the collagenous stroma without prominent osteoblastic activity. In a mature fibrous dysplasia lesion, lamellar bone may be found. Capillaries typically are prominent and uniformly distributed.
Differential Diagnosis
The primary differential consideration for fibrous dysplasia of the jaws is ossifying fibroma. As previously noted, clinical, radiographic, and microscopic features must be considered together to distinguish these processes. The well-circumscribed ossifying fibroma compared with the diffuse fibrous dysplasia often serves as the differentiating factor. Additional features that aid in distinguishing these processes are listed in Box 12-6.
Chronic osteomyelitis occasionally may mimic the radiographic appearance of fibrous dysplasia. Inflammation, often mild, is present in osteomyelitis and may be accompa- nied by symptoms that include tenderness, pain, or drain- age. Periostitis is a radiographic feature of osteomyelitis.

focal cemento-osseous dysplasia, and florid cemento- osseous dysplasia, which are similar disease processes distin- guished on the basis of the extent of involvement of affected portions of the jaws (see Chapter 11 for a comprehensive discussion). Cemento-osseous dysplasia, ossifying fibroma, and fibrous dysplasia have been classified as fibro-osseous lesions of the jaws. These fibro-osseous diseases represent a diverse group of reactive, dysplastic, and neoplastic lesions characterized microscopically by the replacement of normal bone with a collagenous matrix containing trabeculae of immature bone and, in some instances, cementum-like material (see Boxes 12-1 and 12-2).
Osteoblastoma/Osteoid Osteoma
Osteoblastoma is an uncommon primary lesion of bone that occasionally arises in the maxilla or the mandible (Box 12-7). Osteoid osteoma is thought to represent a smaller version of the same tumor, although some prefer to separate these lesions into two distinct entities. These are benign neoplasms of undetermined cause, although a genetic defect has been suggested. Clinically and histologi- cally, they may be confused with osteosarcoma.
Clinical Features
The designation of osteoblastoma is used for lesions larger than 1.5 cm in diameter; the designation of osteoid oste- oma is used for lesions measuring 1.5 cm or less. These le- sions arise most often in vertebrae and long bones and less commonly in the jaws and other craniofacial bones, and make up less than 1% of all primary tumors of bone. The posterior tooth–bearing regions of the maxilla and mandi- ble are the usual sites of jaw involvement (Figure 12-13), with approximately 10% to 12% of typical osteoblastomas occurring in the maxillofacial skeleton, most often in the mandible. Lesions have been reported as arising in medul- lary or periosteal sites. The bony cortices may be expanded and tender to palpation.
Most cases occur during the second decade, with 90% of lesions appearing before the age of 30 years. Males are affected more often than females by a ratio of approximately 2:1.
Pain, often quite severe, is usually associated with osteoid osteoma and can also be a feature of osteoblastoma. Local- ized swelling may occur alone or with pain. Aspirin or

Fibrous Dysplasia vs. Ossifying Fibroma
  The slowly progressive, asymptomatic nature of fibrous dysplasia usually allows differentiation from malignant tumors of bone.
Treatment and Prognosis
After a variable period of prepubertal growth, fibrous dys- plasia characteristically stabilizes, although a slow advance may be noted into adulthood. Small lesions may require no treatment other than biopsy confirmation and periodic follow-up. Large lesions that have caused cosmetic or func- tional deformity may be treated by surgical recontouring. This procedure is generally deferred until after stabilization of the disease process. En bloc resections for complete re- moval are impractical and unnecessary because the lesions are relatively large and poorly delineated.
Medical management with bisphosphonates and mono- clonal antibodies to RANKL (denosumab) have been re- ported to improve symptoms of pain and bone density, but their long-term effects have yet to be determined. Whether other drugs that control osteoclast activity currently in use, or in development, will provide beneficial effects is speculative.
Malignant transformation is a rare complication of fibrous dysplasia (less than 1% of cases) that has been described usually in patients with the polyostotic type. Many of these reported patients were treated with radiation therapy earlier in the course of the disease, suggesting a role for radiation in the transformation process, although malig- nant change has been documented in the absence of radia- tion treatment.
Cemento-Osseous Dysplasia
The term cemento-osseous dysplasia refers to a disease pro- cess of the jaws for which the precise cause is unknown. Cemento-osseous dysplasia describes a spectrum of disor- ders that include periapical cemento-osseous dysplasia,
 • BOX 12-7

nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs relieve symptoms, including nocturnal pain, associated with osteoid osteoma. This relief is less likely to be seen with osteoblastoma. The duration of signs or symptoms of osteoblastoma ranges from weeks to years.
Radiographically, lesions are well circumscribed and have a lytic to mixed lucent-opaque pattern. A thin radio- lucency may be noted surrounding a variably calcified cen- tral tumor mass. Sclerosis of perilesional bone, a constant feature of osteoid osteoma, may be absent in osteoblastoma. Occasionally, a peripheral sun ray pattern of new bone pro- duction may mimic osteosarcoma.
Histopathology
These lesions are composed of irregular trabeculae of oste- oid and immature bone within a stroma containing a prominent vascular network (Figure 12-14). The bony tra- beculae exhibit various degrees of calcification. Remodeling of the osseous tissue may be evident in the form of baso- philic reversal lines. Several layers of plump, hyperchro- matic osteoblasts typically line the bony trabeculae. Stromal cells are generally small and slender, although osteoblast- like cells and multinucleated giant cells may be noted in these areas.
• Figure 12-14 Osteoblastoma showing abundant prominent osteoblasts adjacent to new bone.
Differential Diagnosis
Differential diagnosis considerations include cementoblas- toma, ossifying fibroma, fibrous dysplasia, and osteosarcoma. Cementoblastoma can be differentiated from osteoblastoma because the former lesion arises from the surface of a tooth root and is fused to it. Ossifying fibroma is not painful and microscopically does not have the numbers of osteoblasts seen in osteoblastoma/osteoid osteoma. Fibrous dysplasia has poorly defined radiographic margins and does not have prominent osteoblasts microscopically.
The relatively rapid onset and the pain associated with some osteoblastomas necessitate differentiation from osteo- sarcoma. In biopsy specimens, the hyperchromatic, large osteoblasts noted in osteoblastoma resemble the malignant cells of osteosarcoma. Cytologic atypia, abnormal mitotic figures, delicately calcified tumor osteoid, and a heteroge- neous pattern, all features of osteosarcoma, are not seen in the conventional forms of osteoblastoma/osteoid osteoma.
Treatment and Prognosis
A conservative surgical approach (curettage or local exci- sion) is curative in virtually all cases. In rare instances, these tumors have been associated with a tendency to invade tis- sues locally and to recur subsequently. The term aggressive osteoblastoma has been suggested for such lesions, but most authorities believe that this is an unnecessary subclassifica- tion. Rare examples of malignant transformation of osteo- blastoma have also been reported.
Osteoma
Osteomas are benign tumors that consist of mature, com- pact, or cancellous bone. Osteomas that arise on the surface of bone are referred to as periosteal osteomas, whereas those that develop centrally within bone are endosteal or solitary central osteomas. Osteomas are relatively rare in the jaws. The cause of these lesions is unknown, although trauma, infection, genetic/congenital, and developmental abnor- malities have been suggested as contributing factors.
Clinical Features
Osteomas are most commonly identified during the second to fifth decades of life, and males are affected more often than females. Osteomas are usually solitary, except in patients with Gardner syndrome.
Periosteal osteomas present clinically as asymptomatic, slow-growing, bony, hard masses. Asymmetry may be noted when lesions enlarge to sufficient proportion. Endosteal osteomas occurring within medullary bone may be discov- ered during routine radiographic examination as dense, well-circumscribed radiopacities, because extensive growth must take place before cortical expansion is evident. Osteo- mas may arise in either jaw, with approximately 70% of cases located within the mandible as well as in facial and skull bones and within paranasal sinuses. Symptoms occa- sionally accompany these tumors. Headaches, recurrent

Benign Nonodontogenic Tumors
sinusitis, and ophthalmologic complaints have been noted, depending on the lesion location.
Gardner syndrome, inherited as an autosomal-dominant disorder, is characterized by intestinal polyposis, multiple osteomas, fibromas of the skin, epidermal and trichilemmal cysts, impacted permanent and supernumerary teeth, and odontomas (Figure 12-15). The genetic defect is found in a small region on the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q21), where the familial adenomatous polyposis (APC) gene re- sides. Most patients with Gardner’s syndrome do not exhibit the complete spectrum of clinical disease expression. Osteo- mas associated with this syndrome may be found in the jaws (especially the mandibular angle) and in facial and long bones. Intestinal polyps associated with Gardner syndrome are commonly located in the colon and rectum. Signifi- cantly, these polyps, found microscopically to be adenomas, exhibit a very high rate of malignant transformation to inva- sive colorectal carcinoma.
Histopathology
Two distinct histologic variants of osteoma have been de- scribed. One form is composed of relatively dense, compact bone with sparse marrow tissue. The other form consists of lamellar trabeculae of cancellous bone with abundant fibro- fatty marrow. Osteoblasts may be numerous, but osteoclasts are sparse.
Differential Diagnosis
Osteomas should be distinguished from exostoses of the jaws. Exostoses are bony excrescences on the buccal aspect of alveolar bone. These lesions are of reactive or develop- mental origin and are not thought to be true neoplasms. Osteoblastomas and osteoid osteomas, which might also be considered in a differential diagnosis, are likely to be painful and may exhibit a more rapid rate of growth than osteomas. Osteomas may be confused radiographically with odonto- mas, cementoblastoma, condensing osteitis, osteoblastoma, and focal sclerosing osteomyelitis.
Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment of osteoma consists of surgical excision if symp- tomatic. Lesions should be excised for the purpose of confirming the diagnosis in such cases. In some instances, periodic observation of small, asymptomatic osteomas is appropriate treatment. Osteomas do not recur following surgical removal.
• Figure 12-15 Osteomas of Gardner’s syndrome.
Desmoplastic Fibroma
Desmoplastic fibroma is a benign, locally aggressive lesion of bone that can be considered the bony counterpart of fibromatosis at both gnathic and extragnathic locations (Box 12-8). The tumor usually appears in long bones and the pelvis, but occasionally may affect the jaws. The cause of desmoplastic fibroma is unknown. The lesion usually exhibits locally aggressive clinical behavior, suggesting a neoplastic process. The potential role of genetic, endocrine, and traumatic factors in the pathogenesis of the lesion has led to speculation that it might represent an exuberant re- active proliferation.
Clinical Features
Most cases of desmoplastic fibroma of the jaws have oc- curred in patients younger than 30 years, with a mean age of 14 years. There appears to be no gender predilection. The mandible, usually the body-ramus region, is affected more often than the maxilla (Figure 12-16). The lesions are slowly progressive and asymptomatic, eventually causing swelling of the jaw.
Radiographically, desmoplastic fibroma may be unilocu- lar or multilocular (Figure 12-17). The radiographic mar- gins may be well demarcated or poorly defined. Cortical perforation and root resorption may be seen.

  • Figure 12-17 Desmoplastic fibroma in the right ramus of a 7-year- old boy.
Histopathology
The lesion consists of interlacing bundles and whorled ag- gregates of densely collagenous tissue that contains uniform spindled and elongated fibroblasts (Figure 12-18). Some areas may exhibit hypercellularity with plumper fibroblast nuclei. However, cytologic atypia and mitotic figures are not found. Bone is not produced by lesional tissue. In con- trast to soft tissue desmoid-type fibromatosis, in which nuclear expression of beta-catenin protein and beta-catenin gene mutations are common, these findings are not consis- tently found in desmoplastic fibroma of bone.
Differential Diagnosis
Differential radiographic diagnostic considerations in- clude odontogenic cysts, odontogenic tumors, and non- odontogenic lesions that typically occur in this age group. The presence of aggressive features, such as cortical perfo- ration, or local symptoms might suggest the possibility of a malignancy. In some cases, histopathologic distinction between desmoplastic fibroma and well-differentiated fibrosarcoma may be difficult. The latter would exhibit greater cellularity, mitotic figures, and nuclear pleomor- phism. Some similarities are noted histologically with

contains odontogenic rests.
Treatment and Prognosis
Surgical resection of the lesion is generally reported as the treatment of choice. Curettage alone has been associated with a significant recurrence rate.
Chondroma
Chondroma is a benign cartilaginous tumor of unknown cause. Chondromas are very rarely seen in the jaws, espe- cially in comparison with their occurrence in other skeletal sites.
A chondroma commonly appears as a painless, slowly progressive swelling. Gradual expansion of the lesion rarely results in mucosal ulceration. Most lesions of the craniofa- cial complex arise in the nasal septum and ethmoid sinuses. Chondromas of the maxilla are most often found in the anterior region, where cartilaginous remnants of develop- ment are located. Mandibular chondromas have been noted in the body and symphysis areas, as well as in the coronoid process and the condyle. Chondromas occur with equal incidence in both genders, with the majority of tu- mors appearing before 50 years of age. The radiographic appearance of the chondroma is variable, but it often presents as an irregular radiolucent area. Foci of calcifica- tion may be evident within the radiolucent lesion. Within the temporomandibular joint, lesions histologically similar to chondromas are likely to represent pseudotumors in- cluding synovial chondromatosis, osteochondroma, and other entities.
The lesion consists of well-defined lobules of mature hya- line cartilage. The chondrocytes are small and contain single, regular nuclei. The degree of cellularity varies considerably from one area to another within the chondroma. The princi- pal diagnostic problem rests in microscopically distinguish- ing chondroma from a well-differentiated chondrosarcoma. The latter exhibits a heterogeneous pattern with cytologically atypical and irregularly spaced chondrocytes.

Benign Nonodontogenic Tumors
Chondromas are surgically excised, and recurrence is unusual. Any recurrence should be cause for reconsidering the original diagnosis in favor of the possibility of low-grade malignancy.
Central Giant Cell Granuloma
Central giant cell granuloma (CGCG), or giant cell lesion, is a benign proliferation of fibroblasts and multinucleated giant cells within a well vascularized stroma that occurs almost exclusively within the jaws (Box 12-9). The tumor typically presents as a solitary radiolucent lesion of the mandible or maxilla.
Etiology and Pathogenesis
Thought initially to represent a reparative response to intra- bony hemorrhage and inflammation, CGCG was once regarded as a reactive lesion. However, because of its unpre- dictable and occasionally aggressive behavior, and because of its possible relationship to the giant cell tumor of long bones, CGCG is best considered a benign neoplasm.
The primary tumor cells of CGCGs are fibroblasts. Sec- ondary cells, which are microscopically the most promi- nent, are multinucleated giant cells with osteoclast-like features. Accessory cells, seen in considerably smaller num- bers, include macrophages, factor XIIIa dendritic cells, and endothelial cells. Fibroblasts make up the proliferative com- ponent of CGCGs because they express proteins that are indicative of cells in the cell cycle. Tumor fibroblasts are also believed to be responsible for recruitment and retention of monocytes and their subsequent transformation into multi- nucleated giant cells (Figures 12-19 and 12-20).
Clinical Features
CGCG is not an uncommon lesion but occurs less com- monly than its relatively trivial peripheral or soft tissue counterpart. Lesions are found predominantly in children and young adults, with most cases (75%) presenting before

CGCG occurs almost exclusively in the maxilla and man- dible, although isolated cases in facial bones and small bones of the hands and feet have been reported (Figure 12-21). Lesions are seen more commonly in the mandible than in the maxilla (Figure 12-22). These lesions tend to involve the jaws anterior to the permanent molar teeth, with occasional extension across the midline. Rarely, lesions involve the pos- terior jaws, including the mandibular ramus and condyle.
CGCG typically produces painless expansion or swelling of the affected jaw. Cortical plates are thinned; however, perforation with extension into soft tissues is uncommon. Radiographic features of CGCG consist of a noncorticated multilocular or, less commonly, unilocular radiolucency of bone (Figure 12-23). The margins of the lesion are relatively well demarcated, often presenting a scalloped border. In some instances, CGCG pursues a more aggressive clinical and radio- graphic course. These “aggressive” CGCGs may cause pain or paresthesia. They exhibit rapid growth, root resorption, perfora- tion of cortical bone, and a higher recurrence rate.

• Figure 12-23 Central giant cell granuloma showing loculations and cortical expansion.
Histopathology
CGCG is composed of uniform fibroblasts in a stroma containing various amounts of collagen. Hemosiderin- laden macrophages and extravasated erythrocytes are usually evident, although capillaries are small and incon- spicuous. Multinucleated giant cells are present through- out the connective tissue stroma, and they may be seen in focal aggregates or patches (zonation phenomenon) or distributed evenly (Figures 12-24 and 12-25). Foci of oste- oid may be present, particularly around the peripheral margins of the lesion.
No microscopic features distinguish aggressive CGCGs from nonaggressive ones. Numbers of mitotic figures, cel- lularity, giant cell numbers, giant cell nuclei numbers, and giant cell pattern are not useful in predicting behavior or outcome.
Differential Diagnosis
The clinical differential diagnosis for a solitary or multilocu- lar CGCG includes ameloblastoma, odontogenic myxoma, and odontogenic keratocyst/keratocystic odontogenic tumor. For patients in the characteristic young age range for

CGCG, ameloblastic fibroma, ossifying fibroma, and ade- nomatoid odontogenic tumor might be added to this list.
The microscopic appearance of CGCG is virtually identical to that of the giant cell lesion associated with hyperparathyroidism (Box 12-10). This process must be differentiated on the basis of biochemical tests. An ele- vated serum level of parathyroid hormone indicates pri- mary hyperparathyroidism.
The giant cell tumor of (long) bone may exhibit histo- logic features similar to those of CGCG, although the for- mer tends to have larger giant cells with more nuclei and a homogeneous pattern. Giant cell tumor is believed to occur rarely in the jaws, although differentiation from CGCG can be difficult.
Other giant cell–containing look-alikes or entities containing multinucleated giant cells include aneurys- mal bone cyst and cherubism. Diagnosis of aneurysmal bone cyst is made by identification of sinusoidal blood spaces within the tumor mass. Cherubism is diagnosed on clinical, pathologic, and genetic (SH3BP2 mutations) grounds. Of note is the so-called cherubism gene, SH3BP2, which is not mutated in CGCG. Patients who develop multiple giant cell lesions may represent a rare syndrome known as Noonan-like/multiple giant cell

lesion syndrome. These patients have many phenotypic features in common with Noonan syndrome, as well as mutations in the PTPN11 gene.
Treatment and Prognosis
Surgical management of these lesions is the treatment of choice. Excision or curettage of the tumor mass followed by removal of the peripheral bony margins results in a good prognosis and a low recurrence rate. A somewhat higher rate of recurrence has been reported in lesions arising in children and young teens. Lesions with aggressive clinical features also exhibit a tendency to recur, often necessitating more extensive surgical approaches, including resection. Although numerous medical therapies have been tried in an attempt to control aggressive CGCGs, reports have been anecdotal and not part of a clinical controlled study. Intra- lesional injections of corticosteroids have been proposed, but results are varied and the rationale of this therapy is questionable. Exogenous calcitonin administration may have some merit in the treatment of aggressive lesions. Pre- liminary data suggest that lesions may stabilize or regress after several months of therapy. Interferon-alpha has been proposed as an additional treatment modality on the basis of an antiangiogenic mode of action. Its efficacy, as an ad- junct or primary mode of therapy, has yet to be determined. Bisphosphonates, because of their inhibitory effects on os- teoclasts, have been suggested as an alternative or adjunct to surgery. Similarly, the use of RANK ligand antibodies (denosumab) may be useful in targeting osteoclast-like giant cells in this lesion.
Giant Cell Tumor
Giant cell tumors are true neoplasms that arise most com- monly in long bones, especially in the area of the knee joint. These tumors exhibit a wide spectrum of biological behav- ior from benign to malignant. The relationship between this lesion and CGCG is controversial. Most regard the giant cell tumor as distinct from CGCG, acknowledging the very rare occurrence of giant cell tumor within the jaws.

 • Figure 12-26 Giant cell tumor showing particularly large giant cells with abundant nuclei.
Giant cell tumors, although rare, have been reported in the jaws. Other sites of involvement in the head and neck include the sphenoid, ethmoid, and temporal bones. Giant cell tumors are most often seen in the third and fourth decades of life. Lesions exhibit slow growth and bone expansion, or they produce rapid growth, pain, or paresthesia. Radiographically, the giant cell tumor produces a radiolucent image.
Microscopically, this tumor is characterized by the pres- ence of numerous multinucleated giant cells dispersed evenly among monocyte-macrophages and spindle cells (Figure 12-26). It has been proposed that the spindle cells represent the neoplastic cells in this tumor, and that the monocyte-macrophages are reactive, giving rise to giant cells through recruitment and induction factors (e.g., tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha, macrophage colony-stimulat- ing factor) secreted by the tumor spindle cells.
Stromal cellularity is usually prominent, with minimal collagen production. Giant cells in giant cell tumors are usu- ally larger and contain more nuclei than the corresponding cells of CGCG. Significant variation is noted, however, such that any given lesion may present diagnostic difficulty because of considerable histologic overlap. Giant cell tumors may contain inflammatory cells and areas of necrosis while exhibiting a relative absence of hemorrhage and hemosiderin deposition. Osteoid formation is noted less often than in giant cell granulomas.
Surgical excision is the treatment of choice for giant cell tumors. Promising clinical results have been associated with the use of anti-osteoclastogenic drugs (bisphosphonates, monoclonal antibody to RANK ligand [denosumab]). These lesions exhibit a greater tendency to recur after treat- ment than do giant cell granulomas. Although too few cases have been reported in the jaws to predict recurrence rates, it is noteworthy that 30% of lesions in long bones recur after curettage.
Hemangioma of Bone
Hemangiomas of bone are rare intraosseous vascular mal- formations that, when seen in the jaws, can mimic both
odontogenic and nonodontogenic lesions. Difficult-to- control hemorrhage is a notable complication of surgical intervention.
Clinical Features
More than half of central hemangiomas of the jaws occur in the mandible, especially the posterior region. The lesion occurs approximately twice as often in females as in males. The peak age of discovery is the second decade of life.
A firm, slow-growing, asymmetric expansion of the mandible or maxilla is the most common patient com- plaint. Spontaneous gingival bleeding around teeth in the area of the hemangioma may also be noted. Paresthesia or pain, as well as vertical mobility of involved teeth, is occa- sionally evident. Bruits or pulsation of large lesions may be detected with careful auscultation or palpation of the thinned cortical plates. Trophic effects of the hemangioma on adjacent hard and soft tissues are common. Significantly, hemangiomas may be present with no signs or symptoms.
Radiographically, more than half of jaw hemangiomas occur as multilocular radiolucencies that have a characteris- tic soap bubble appearance (Figure 12-27). A second form of these lesions consists of a rounded, radiolucent lesion in which bony trabeculae radiate from the center of the lesion, producing angular loculations. Less commonly, hemangio- mas appear as cystlike radiolucencies. The lesions may pro- duce resorption of the roots of teeth in the area.
Histopathology
Hemangiomas of bone represent a proliferation of blood vessels (Figure 12-28). Most intrabony hemangiomas are of the cavernous type (large-caliber vessels), while fewer are of the capillary type (small-caliber vessels). However, separa- tion of hemangiomas into one of these two microscopic subtypes is academic, because no differences in biological behavior are noted.
Differential Diagnosis
The differential diagnosis of multilocular hemangioma of bone includes ameloblastoma, odontogenic myxoma,

odontogenic keratocyst, CGCG, and aneurysmal bone cyst. A unilocular lesion may be easily confused with other cystic processes that occur within the jaws. Angiography often provides useful information in establishing the diagnosis of hemangioma.
Treatment and Prognosis
The most significant feature of hemangioma of bone is that these lesions may prove life threatening if improperly man- aged. Extraction of teeth in an area involved by a central vascular lesion may result in potentially fatal bleeding. It is imperative to perform needle aspiration of any central lesion that may be of vascular origin before performing a biopsy.
Methods used in the treatment of hemangioma of bone include surgery, radiation therapy, sclerosing agents, cryother- apy, and presurgical embolization techniques. The vascular supply of a given lesion, as well as its size and location, must be evaluated before a given treatment method is selected.
Langerhans Cell Disease
Langerhans cell disease (LCD), formerly known as histiocy- tosis X and idiopathic histiocytosis, is a spectrum of disor- ders characterized by a proliferation of cells exhibiting phenotypic characteristics of Langerhans cells, though the skin or mucosal Langerhans cell is not the cell of origin. Rather, a myeloid dendritic cell bearing markers shared with cutaneous Langerhans cells (CD1Aa and CD207) is felt to be the cell of origin. The neoplastic nature of this condition has been confirmed by demonstration of clonal- ity in most cases with clinical manifestations ranging from solitary to multiple bone lesions to disseminated progressive visceral, skin, and bone lesions with highly variable behav- ior patterns from progressive fatal disease to those charac- terized by spontaneous resolution.
Historically, the term histiocytosis X was used to encom- pass three disorders: eosinophilic granuloma, Hand-Schüller- Christian syndrome, and Letterer-Siwe disease (Box 12-11). These entities were grouped together because of their similar microscopic appearance, despite the diverse manner of clinical
Eosinophilic granuloma (chronic localized): solitary or multiple bone lesions
Hand-Schüller-Christian (chronic disseminated): bone lesions, exophthalmos, diabetes insipidus
Letterer-Siwe (acute disseminated): bone, skin, internal organs affected
disease expression. Eosinophilic granuloma, or chronic local- ized LCD, refers to solitary or multiple bone lesions only. Hand-Schüller-Christian syndrome, or chronic disseminated LCD, is a specific clinical triad of lytic bone lesions, exoph- thalmos, and diabetes insipidus. Many affected persons also exhibit lymphadenopathy, dermatitis, splenomegaly, or hepa- tomegaly. Letterer-Siwe disease, or acute disseminated LCD, is a malignant process characterized by a rapidly progressive, often fatal course. Widespread organ, bone, and skin involve- ment by the proliferative process in infants has been the com- mon presentation.
Etiology and Pathogenesis
The etiology and pathogenesis of LCD is discussed above (Box 12-12). Ultrastructural and immunohistochemical similarities have demonstrated that LCD tumor cells are morphologically similar to normal Langerhans cells that reside in the epidermis and mucosa and share surface pro- tein receptors. How LCD develops from normal Langer- hans cells or their precursor cells is unknown.
The acute form of this disease and some cases of the chronic forms are thought to represent a neoplastic trans- formation. However, abnormalities of DNA content in the proliferative cells have been demonstrated in only a few cases of LCD. More recent investigations in a limited num- ber of patients have demonstrated clonal proliferation of Langerhans cells, supporting the concept of a neoplastic process. Evidence is emerging that some patients with LCD may exhibit defects in certain aspects of the cell-mediated arm of the immune system. A deficiency of suppressor T cells, as well as low levels of serum thymic factor, suggests the presence of a thymic abnormality in this disease. These

immunologic defects may affect normal regulatory mecha- nisms, with resultant Langerhans cell type proliferation.
Clinical Features
LCD is generally a condition of children and young adults, but the age range extends to older adults. Monostotic and polyostotic forms of the disorder may affect virtually any bone of the body. The skull, mandible, ribs, vertebrae, and long bones are often involved (Figure 12-29). Oral changes may be the initial presentation in all forms of this disorder. Skin, mucosal, or bone involvement in the head and neck region was noted in more than 80% of children in one study. Tenderness, pain, and swelling are common patient complaints. Loosening of teeth in the area of the affected alveolar bone is a common occurrence. The gingival tissues are often inflamed, hyperplastic, and ulcerated. Oral muco- sal lesions in the form of submucosal nodules, ulcers, and leukoplakia have been described.
The jaws may exhibit solitary or multiple radiolucent lesions (Figures 12-30 and 12-31). Lesions often affect the alveolar bone, causing the teeth to appear as if they were

floating in space. Bone lesions with a sharply circumscribed, punched-out appearance may occur in the central aspect of the mandible or maxilla. These lesions occasionally are located exclusively in a periapical site, where they may mimic periapical inflammatory lesions. Jaw lesions may be accompanied by bone involvement elsewhere in the skele- ton. Cervical lymphadenopathy, mastoiditis, and otitis media are head and neck manifestations that often present with multifocal involvement.
Histopathology
LCD is characterized by the proliferation of large cells with abundant cytoplasm, indistinct cell borders, and oval to reniform nuclei. These cells most often are arranged in sheets and may be admixed with various numbers of eo- sinophils and other inflammatory cells (Figure 12-32). A second population of macrophages is often evident. Multinucleated giant cells and foci of necrosis may be noted. The ultrastructure of the tumor cells shows unique, rod-shaped cytoplasmic structures, which are identical to Birbeck granules, present in normal Langerhans cells (Figure 12-33). Immunohistochemical stains show that the tumor cells express CD1a antigen, S-100 protein, and human leukocyte antigens (HLA)-DR; this is also charac- teristic of normal Langerhans cells. It should be noted that CD1a and CD207 (langerin) are useful markers for nor- mal Langerhans cells and the pathologic cells in LCD. The monoclonal antibodies reactive to CD1a and CD207 are effective for immunohistochemical analysis of formalin- fixed tissue, replacing the less specific anti–S-100 protein for the confirmation of LCD.
Differential Diagnosis
The classic presentation of LCD in the jaws often results in loosening or premature exfoliation of teeth and precocious eruption of permanent teeth. Under these conditions, a differential diagnosis should include juvenile or diabetic periodontitis, hypophosphatasia, leukemia, cyclic neutro- penia, agranulocytosis, and primary or metastatic malig- nant neoplasms. Lesions located in a periapical site may be confused with a periapical cyst or granuloma; the presence of pulp vitality excludes this possibility.

Solitary radiolucent lesions in the central aspects of the jaws should be differentiated from odontogenic tumors and cysts. Numerous well-circumscribed radiolucencies may suggest multiple myeloma, although this occurs in a much older age group. Less commonly, non-Langerhans histiocy- toses including Rosai-Dorfman disease, Erdheim-Chester disease, and juvenile xanthogranuloma, are among others that may enter the differential diagnosis. Histologic exami- nation with immunohistochemical analysis of tissue removed for a biopsy generally serves to distinguish this disorder from the other entities listed.
Treatment and Prognosis
Generally, the younger the patient at the time of disease onset, the poorer the overall prognosis, as the disease tends to be more generalized and severe. The acute disseminated form commonly occurs during the first years of life and pursues a rapidly progressive course. The primary method of treatment involves the use of chemotherapeutic agents (Box 12-13). The disease may be fatal despite intensive treatment. Patients with a poor prognosis have been

Disseminated visceral and bone involvement in some- what older children often behaves in a more chronic fashion. Individual lesions may be managed effectively with surgical curettage or low-dose radiation therapy. Cytotoxic agents, such as vincristine sulfate, cyclophos- phamide, and methotrexate, often in conjunction with systemic corticosteroids, may be used for widespread or visceral involvement. The prognosis in this form of the disease is more optimistic, with half of patients surviving for 10 to 15 years.
The localized form of LCD occurs in older children, adolescents, and young adults. These lesions may be treated successfully with vigorous surgical curettage, al- though intralesional corticosteroid injections and low- dose radiotherapy have been reported to be effective. Spontaneous regression of restricted disease has been reported, making treatment in some cases unnecessary. Involved teeth generally are sacrificed at the time of surgi- cal therapy because of the absence of bony support. The prognosis for this form of the disorder is good. Patients must be evaluated for additional bone or visceral involve- ment, which is usually manifested within the first 6 months after detection of the original lesion. Long- term follow-up is necessary to rule out the possibility of recurrent disease.

Tori and Exostoses
Tori and exostoses are nodular protuberances of mature bone; their precise designation depends on the anatomic location. These lesions are of little clinical significance be- cause they are non-neoplastic and rarely are a source of discomfort. The mucosa surfacing these lesions occasionally may be traumatically ulcerated, producing a slow-healing, painful wound or, less commonly, osteomyelitis. Surgical removal for the purpose of prosthetic rehabilitation may be necessary.
Etiology and Pathogenesis
The precise cause of these lesions remains obscure, al- though evidence has suggested that the torus may be an inherited condition. A simple dominant pattern of in- heritance was identified for palatal tori in a study of Venezuelan and Japanese populations. One investigator has indicated that both genetic and environmental factors determine the development of mandibular tori. The pala- tal torus is relatively prevalent in certain populations such as Asians, Native Americans, and the Inuit (Eskimos). Incidence in the general population of the United States is between 20% and 25%.
Mandibular tori are seen more commonly in certain groups such as blacks and some Asian populations. Overall incidence in the United States is estimated to be between 6% and 12%. The presence of mandibular tori was studied in patients with migraine headaches and temporomandibu- lar disorders. A positive association suggested a possible role of parafunctional habits in the origin of this condition.
The cause of exostoses is unknown. It has been suggested that the bony growths represent a reaction to increased or abnormal occlusal stresses of the teeth in involved areas.
Clinical Features
Torus Palatinus
The palatal torus is a sessile, nodular mass of bone that ap- pears along the midline of the hard palate (Figure 12-34). This lesion occurs in females twice as often as it does in males in some populations, with significant racial and ethnic
differences reported. The palatal torus usually appears dur- ing the second or third decade of life, although it may be noted at any age. The bony mass exhibits slow growth and generally is asymptomatic. These lesions are often present in a symmetric fashion along the midline of the hard palate. Tori have been noted to form various configurations such as nodular, spindled, lobular, or flat. Large tori may be evident on radiographs as diffuse radiopaque lesions.
Torus Mandibularis
Mandibular tori are bony exophytic growths that appear along the lingual aspect of the mandible superior to the my- lohyoid ridge (Figure 12-35). These tori are almost always bilateral, occurring in the premolar region. Infrequently, a torus may be noted on one side only. These lesions are asymptomatic, exhibiting slow growth during the second and third decades of life.
Mandibular tori may arise as solitary nodules or as mul- tiple nodular masses that appear to coalesce. A significant gender predilection is not evident. It is curious that mandibular and palatal tori do not often occur together in the same individual.
Exostoses
Exostoses are multiple (or single) bony excrescences that are less common compared with tori. They are asymptomatic bony nodules that are present along the buccal aspect of alveolar bone (Figures 12-36 and 12-37). Lesions are noted most often in the posterior portions of both the maxilla and the mandible. Rarely, exostoses have occurred under skin grafts to gingiva (vestibuloplasties) and subjacent to pontics of fixed bridges.
Histopathology
These lesions are composed of hyperplastic bone consisting of mature cortical and trabecular bone. The outer surface exhibits a smooth, rounded contour.
Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment of tori and exostoses is unnecessary unless it is required for prosthetic considerations, or in cases of frequent

trauma to the overlying mucosa. Recurrence after surgical
excision is only rarely seen.
Coronoid Hyperplasia
Hyperplasia of the coronoid processes of the mandible is an uncommon condition that is often associated with limited mandibular motion.
Etiology and Pathogenesis
The cause of this process remains unknown. A history of trauma is present in many instances; however, the precise relationship between the traumatic episode and the onset of coronoid enlargement has been difficult to establish. Coro- noid enlargement appears to represent a hyperplastic pro- cess, although it has been suggested that the lesion may be neoplastic. Unilateral coronoid hyperplasia may be the result of a solitary osteochondroma; bilateral coronoid hyperplasia is apparently the result of a different process. Most cases have been reported in males, leading some inves- tigators to suggest an X-linked inherited origin. However, some cases have been reported in females, a finding that seems to preclude this possibility. Increased activity of the temporalis muscle with unbalanced condylar support has also been postulated as a causative factor.
Clinical Features
Hyperplasia of the coronoid processes is often bilateral, al- though unilateral enlargement has been noted. Bilateral coronoid hyperplasia typically results in limited mandibular movement, which is progressive over time.
The disorder is usually painless and, with a few excep- tions, is not associated with facial swelling or asymmetry. Coronoid hyperplasia has been reported most often in young male patients. The age of onset is typically around puberty, although presentation for evaluation may be de- layed for many years. Some cases have been noted, espe- cially in females, before puberty and during adult life.
Enlarged and elongated coronoid processes are evident radiographically, although the general shape of the processes is usually normal. Unilateral coronoid hyperplasia often results in misshapen or mushroom-shaped coronoid pro- cesses on radiographs. Temporomandibular joint radio- graphs are unremarkable.
Histopathology
Enlarged coronoid processes consist of mature, hyperplastic bone. The bone may be partially covered by cartilaginous and fibrous connective tissue.
Differential Diagnosis
Bilateral coronoid hyperplasia rarely presents diagnostic difficulties. However, cases of unilateral coronoid hyper- plasia must be differentiated from osseous and chondroid neoplasms.
Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment consists of surgical excision of the hyperplastic coronoid processes. Postoperative physiotherapy is also advo- cated. Long-term functional improvement has been variably successful as measured by an increase in mouth opening after surgical intervention. Recurrence has been reported rarely.

 Osteomyelitis, by definition, is inflammation, not neces- sarily infection (by a microorganism), of bone and bone marrow. The term osteitis may be substituted for osteo- myelitis to indicate inflammation of bone. In the man- dible and maxilla, most cases are related to a microbial (usually bacterial) infection that reaches the bone through nonvital teeth, periodontal lesions, or traumatic injuries. This, coupled with the patient’s host resistance factors, determines the clinical presentation, the extent of the inflammatory process, and the speed with which the infection develops. Recognized subtypes of osteomy- elitis are closely related and essentially represent differ- ences in the causative agent and the host response. The primary justification for separation of osteomyelitis into various subtypes lies in the differences in treatment and prognosis for each. It is important to be aware of clinical and radiographic presentations when making differential diagnoses of bone lesions.

All the principles of inflammation that apply to any other body organ apply to lesions of the dental pulp. In addi- tion, dental pulp has some unique features that make it unusually fragile and sensitive. First, it is encased by hard tissue (dentin/enamel) that does not allow for the usual
swelling associated with the exudate of the acute inflam- matory process. Second, there is no collateral circulation to maintain vitality when the primary blood supply is compromised. Third, biopsies and direct applications of medication are impossible without causing necrosis of the entire pulp. Fourth, pain and increasing levels of sensitiv- ity are the only signs that can be used to determine the severity of pulpal inflammation.
Because of referred pain and the lack of proprioceptors (position sensors) in the pulp, localizing the problem to the correct tooth can often be a considerable diagnostic challenge. Also there may be a poor correlation between clinical symptoms and pathologic changes occurring in the pulp. The level of pulpal inflammation is determined through a combination of clinical criteria. Results of elec- tric, heat, cold, and percussion tests must be added to the patient history, clinical examination, and clinician experi- ence to arrive at the most appropriate diagnosis for the correct tooth. Generally, the more intense the pain and the longer the duration of symptoms, the greater the damage to the pulp. Severe symptoms usually indicate irreversible damage.
Etiology
In the dental pulp, just as it is in any other tissue, in- flammation is the response to injury. In addition, the pulpal response includes stimulation of odontoblasts to deposit reparative dentin at the site to help protect the pulp. If the injury is severe, the result is necrosis of these cells.
Caries is the most common form of injury that causes pulpitis. The degree of damage depends on the rapidity and extent of hard tissue destruction. Entry of bacteria into the pulpal tissue through a carious lesion is not neces- sary for pulpitis to occur, but this appears to be an impor- tant factor in the intensification of the inflammatory re- sponse. Pulpal microbiology adjacent to carious dentin demonstrates a diverse flora, including gram-positive an- aerobes with low numbers of lactobacilli. Operative dental procedures associated with cavity and crown preparations may also trigger an inflammatory response in the dental

pulp. The heat, friction, chemicals, and filling materials associated with restoration of teeth are all potential irri- tants. It is well known that less damage occurs when a cooling water spray is used during tooth preparation than when no water is used. It is also well established that an insulating base (such as zinc oxide and eugenol under amalgam restorations or glass ionomer under a composite restoration) can provide significant protection of the pulp from irritating chemicals used in the preparation of non- metallic restorative materials and from heat transferred through large metallic fillings.
Other types of injury that may trigger pulpitis are trauma, especially when it is severe enough to cause root or crown fracture, and periodontal disease that has extended to an apical or lateral root foramen.
Clinical and Histopathologic Features
Several detailed classifications of pulpitis that are based on histopathologic changes have been proposed. Because of the difficulty in correlating clinical features with microscopy, these schemes have proved to be of little practical value. Instead, most practitioners prefer a simple classification that is helpful in the clinical setting relative to treatment and prognosis (Table 13-1).
Focal Reversible Pulpitis. Focal reversible pulpitis is an acute, mild inflammatory pulpal reaction that typically follows carious destruction of a tooth or placement of a large metallic filling without an insulating base. It causes hypersensitivity to thermal and electrical stimuli. The pain is mild to moderate and is typically intermittent. As the name implies, the changes are focal (subjacent to the inju- rious agent) and reversible if the cause is removed. Micro- scopically, the predominant feature is dilation and en- gorgement of blood vessels (hyperemia). Exudation of plasma proteins also occurs, but this is difficult to appreci- ate in microscopic sections.
Acute Pulpitis. The inflammatory response of acute pul- pitis may occur as progression of focal reversible pulpitis, or
Pulpitis and Periapical Diseases
it may represent an acute exacerbation of an already estab- lished chronic pulpitis. Pulpal damage may range in severity from simple acute inflammation marked by vessel dilation, exudation, and neutrophil chemotaxis to focal liquefaction necrosis (pulp abscess) to total pulpal suppurative necrosis. Constant, severe, tooth-associated pain is the usual present- ing complaint. Pain is intensified with the application of heat or cold, although in cases in which liquefaction of the pulp has occurred, cold may in fact alleviate the symptoms. If there is an opening from the pulp to the oral environ- ment, symptoms may be lessened because of escape of the exudate that causes pressure on and chemical irritation of pulpal and periapical nerve tissues.
In the early phases of acute pulpitis, the tooth may be hyperreactive to electrical stimulation, but as pulp damage increases, sensitivity is reduced until there is no response. Because the exudate is confined primarily to the pulp rather than the periapical tissues, percussion tests generally elicit a response that differs little from normal.
Chronic Pulpitis. Chronic pulpitis is an inflammatory reaction that results from long-term, low-grade injury or occasionally from quiescence of an acute process. Symp- toms, characteristically mild and often intermittent, appear over an extended period. A dull ache may be the presenting complaint, or the patient may have no symptoms at all. As the pulp deteriorates, responses to thermal and electrical stimulation are reduced. Microscopically, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and fibrosis appear in the chronically inflamed pulp. Unless an acute exacerbation of the chronic process occurs, neutrophils are not evident.
Chronic Hyperplastic Pulpitis. This special form of chronic pulpitis occurs in the molar teeth (both primary and permanent) of children and young adults. Involved teeth exhibit large carious lesions that open into the coronal pulp chamber. Rather than undergoing necrosis, the pulp tissue reacts in a hyperplastic manner, producing a red mass of reparative granulation tissue that extrudes through the pulp exposure. This type of reaction is believed to be related

Symptoms seldom occur because there is no exudate under pressure, and generally no nerve tissue is proliferating with the granulation tissue. Although the pulp tissue is vi- able, the process is not reversible, and endodontic therapy or tooth extraction may be necessary. The well-vascularized granulation tissue mass often becomes epithelialized, presumably by autotransplantation of epithelial cells from nearby mucosal surfaces.
Treatment and Prognosis
If the cause is identified and eliminated, focal reversible pul- pitis should recede, returning the pulp to a normal state. If inflammation progresses into an acute pulpitis with neutro- phil infiltrates and tissue necrosis, recovery is unlikely, regard- less of attempts to remove the cause. Endodontic therapy or tooth extraction is the only available treatment at this stage.
With chronic pulpitis, pulpal death is the characteristic end result (Figure 13-1). Removal of the cause may slow the process or occasionally may save the vitality of the pulp. End- odontic therapy or extraction is typically required. Chronic hyperplastic pulpitis is essentially an irreversible end stage that is treated with pulp extirpation and an endodontic filling or extraction.
Periapical Abscess
Etiology
Numerous sequelae may follow untreated pulp necrosis and are dependent on the virulence of the microorganisms involved and the integrity of the patient’s overall defense mechanisms (Figure 13-2). From its origin in the pulp, the inflammatory process extends into the periapical tissues, where it may present as a granuloma or cyst (if chronic) or an abscess (if acute). Acute exacerbation of a chronic lesion may also be seen. Necrotic pulpal tissue debris,
• Figure 13-2 Pathogenesis of periapical inflammation.
inflammatory cells, and bacteria, particularly anaerobes and facultative anaerobes, all serve to stimulate and sustain the periapical inflammatory process. Application of modern molecular diagnostics has shown that there is a considerably greater diversity of microorganisms in periapical abscesses than identified with the classic culture techniques.
Clinical Features
Patients with periapical abscesses typically have severe pain in the area of the nonvital tooth caused by pressure and the effects of inflammatory chemical mediators on nerve tissue. The exudate and neutrophilic infiltrate of an abscess put pressure on surrounding tissue, often resulting in slight extrusion of the tooth from its socket. Pus associated with a lesion, if not focally constrained, seeks the path of least resistance and spreads into con- tiguous structures (Figures 13-3 to 13-5). The affected area of the jaw may be tender to palpation, and the patient may be hypersensitive to tooth percussion. The involved tooth is unresponsive to electrical and thermal tests because of pulp necrosis.

Because of the rapidity with which this lesion devel- ops, time is generally insufficient for significant amounts of bone resorption to occur. Therefore, radiographic changes are slight and usually limited to mild radio- graphic thickening of the apical periodontal membrane space. However, if a periapical abscess develops as a re- sult of acute exacerbation of a chronic periapical granu- loma, a radiolucent lesion is evident. The periapical granuloma represents the result of chronic inflammation at the apex of a nonvital tooth. This is a sequela of pulp necrosis, which may develop through acute or low-grade chronic inflammation. Notably, other more serious con- ditions can occur in a periapical position (Box 13-1). Various clinical clues may alert the clinician that the periapical lesion may not be a simple dental granuloma (Box 13-2).
Histopathology
Microscopically, a periapical abscess appears as a zone of liquefaction composed of proteinaceous exudate, necrotic tissue, and viable and dead neutrophils (pus).
Adjacent tissue containing dilated vessels and a neutro- philic infiltrate surrounds the area of liquefaction necrosis.
With chronicity, an abscess develops into a granu- loma, which is composed of granulation tissue and fibrous tissue infiltrated by variable numbers of neutro- phils, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages. (Note: periapical granuloma is to be distinguished from granulomatous inflammation, which is a distinctive type of chronic inflammation that is characteristic of certain diseases [e.g., tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, histoplasmosis] and features a predominance of macrophages and often multinucleated giant cells.) Acute flare of a periapical granuloma would show an abundant neutrophilic infil- trate in addition to granulation tissue and chronic inflammatory cells.
Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment of an acute periapical abscess requires observance of the standard principles of management of acute inflam- mation. Drainage should be established through an open- ing in the tooth itself or through the soft tissue surrounding the jaw, if cellulitis has developed. Antibiotics directed against the offending organism are required. Management must be thoughtful and skilled because the consequences of delayed or inappropriate treatment can be significant and occasionally life threatening.

Spread of an abscess may occur through one of several avenues. It may progress through the buccal cortical bone and gingival soft tissue, establishing a natural drain or sinus tract. The same type of situation may occur in the palate or skin; this depends on the original location of the abscess and the path of least resistance. If a drain is not established, the purulent exudate can cause an abscess or cellulitis in the soft tissues of the face, oral cavity, or neck. Cellulitis is an acute inflammatory pro- cess that is diffusely spread throughout the tissue rather than localized, as with an abscess. This variant is a result of infection by virulent organisms that produce enzymes that allow rapid spread through tissue. Bilateral cellulitis of the submandibular and sublingual spaces has been called Ludwig’s angina.
A dangerous situation occurs when acute infection involves major blood vessels, possibly resulting in bacteremia. Also, retrograde spread of the infection through facial emissary veins to the cavernous sinus may set up the necessary condi- tions for thrombus formation. Cavernous sinus thrombosis is an often fatal emergency situation.
Treatment of periapical granulomas and cysts is discussed in Chapter 10.
Acute Osteomyelitis
Etiology
Acute inflammation of the bone and bone marrow of the mandible and maxilla results most often from extension of a periapical abscess (Figure 13-6). The second most com- mon cause of acute osteomyelitis is physical injury, such as occurs with fracture or surgery. Osteomyelitis may also result from bacteremia.
• Figure 13-6 Potential spread of pus from a mandibular periapical abscess. (Reproduced with permission from Regezi JA, Sciubba JJ, Pogrel MA: Atlas of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology. Philadelphia, 2000, WB Saunders, Figure 10-11.)
Most cases of acute osteomyelitis are infectious. Al- most any organism may be part of the etiologic picture, although staphylococci and streptococci are identified most often.
Clinical Features
Pain is the primary feature of this inflammatory process. Pyrexia, painful lymphadenopathy, leukocytosis, and other signs and symptoms of acute infection are com- monly present. Paresthesia of the lower lip occasionally occurs with mandibular involvement. In the develop- ment of a clinical differential diagnosis, the presence of this symptom should also suggest malignant mandibular neoplasms.
To be visible by conventional radiography, a lesion must have resorbed or demineralized approximately 60% of the bone. Therefore, unless the inflammatory process has been present for some time, radiographic evidence of acute osteo- myelitis usually is not present. Over time, diffuse radiolu- cent changes begin to appear as more bone is resorbed and replaced by infection.
Histopathology
A purulent exudate occupies the marrow spaces in acute osteomyelitis. Bony trabeculae show reduced osteoblastic activity and increased osteoclastic resorption. If an area of bone necrosis occurs (sequestrum), osteocytes are lost and the marrow undergoes liquefaction.
Treatment
Acute osteomyelitis usually is treated with antibiotics and drainage. Ideally, the causative agent is identified, and an appropriate antibiotic is selected through sensi- tivity testing in the laboratory. Surgery may also be part of the treatment and ranges from simple sequestrectomy to excision with autologous bone replacement. Each case should be judged individually because of variations in disease severity, the organisms involved, and the patient’s overall health.
Chronic Osteomyelitis (Chronic Osteitis)
Etiology
Chronic osteomyelitis may be one of the sequelae of acute osteomyelitis (untreated or inadequately treated), or it may represent a long-term, low-grade inflammatory reac- tion that never went through a significant or clinically noticeable acute phase (Box 13-3 and Table 13-2). In ei- ther event, acute and chronic forms of osteomyelitis have many similar causative factors. Most cases are infectious, and, as in most infections, the clinical presentation and the course are directly dependent on the virulence of the microorganism involved and the patient’s resistance. The anatomic location, immunologic status, nutritional status, and patient’s age, as well as the presence of preexisting systemic factors, such as Paget’s disease, osteopetrosis, or

Identification of a specific infectious agent involved in chronic osteomyelitis is usually difficult both microscopi- cally and microbiologically. Sample error is significant because of small, difficult-to-reach bacterial foci, or be- cause of contamination of the lesion by resident flora. Previously taken antibiotics reduce the chances of cultur- ing the causative organism. Although a causative agent often is not confirmed, most investigators believe that bacteria (e.g., staphylococci, streptococci, bacteroides, ac- tinomyces) are responsible for the vast majority of cases of chronic osteomyelitis.
Osteoradionecrosis. (See also Chapter 2.) Bone irradi- ated as part of head and neck cancer treatment is particu- larly susceptible to infection. Because of reduced vascular- ity and osteocyte destruction, osteoradionecrosis may occur in up to 20% of patients who have undergone local tumoricidal irradiation. Secondary infection generally fol- lows. Typical precipitating or triggering events include periapical inflammation resulting from nonvital teeth,
Chronic Osteomyelitis: Types and Features
extractions, periodontal disease, and fractures communi- cating with skin or mucosa.
Clinical Features
The mandible, especially the molar area, is much more commonly affected than the maxilla. This may relate, in part, to the more diffuse blood supply and the greater proportion of cancellous bone in the maxilla. Pain is usu- ally present but varies in intensity, and it is not necessarily related to the extent of disease. The duration of symp- toms is generally proportional to the extent of disease. Swelling of the jaw is a commonly encountered sign; loose teeth and sinus tracts are seen less often. Anesthesia is very uncommon.
Radiographically, chronic osteomyelitis appears primar- ily as a radiolucent lesion that may show focal zones of opacification. The lucent pattern is often described as moth-eaten because of its mottled radiographic appearance (Figures 13-7 and 13-8). Lesions may be very extensive, and margins are often indistinct.
Histopathology
The inflammatory reaction in chronic osteomyelitis can vary from very mild to intense. In mild cases, micro- scopic diagnosis can be difficult because of similarities to fibro-osseous lesions such as ossifying fibroma and fi- brous dysplasia. A few chronic inflammatory cells (lym- phocytes and plasma cells) are seen in a fibrous marrow (Figure 13-9). Both osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity may be seen, along with irregular bony trabeculae, which are unlikely features of fibro-osseous lesions. In advanced chronic osteomyelitis, necrotic bone (sequestrum) may be present, as evidenced by both necrotic marrow and necrotic osteocytes. Reversal lines reflect the waves of deposition and resorption of bone. Inflammatory cells are more numerous and osteoclastic activity more prom- inent than in mild cases.

• Figure 13-9 Chronic osteomyelitis showing fibrous marrow and osteoclastic resorption of resident bone.
Treatment
The basic treatment of chronic osteomyelitis centers on the selection of appropriate antibiotics and the proper timing of surgical intervention. Culture and sensitivity testing should be carried out. Occasionally, combina- tions of antibiotics may be more successful than single agents. The duration of antibiotic administration may be relatively extended.
When a sequestrum develops, surgical removal appears to hasten the healing process. Excision of other nonvital bone, sinus tracts, and scar tissue has been advocated. In cases in which the potential for pathologic fracture is sig- nificant, immobilization is required.
In recalcitrant cases of chronic osteomyelitis and in most cases of osteoradionecrosis, the use of hyperbaric oxygen has provided significant benefit for patients. In difficult cases, hyperbaric oxygen used in conjunction with antibiotics or surgery appears to be generally better than any of these methods used alone. The rationale for using hyperbaric oxygen is related to its stimulation of vascular proliferation, collagen synthesis, and osteogen- esis. Contraindications include the presence of viral in- fections, optic neuritis, known residual or recurrent malignancies, and some lung diseases. The regimen typi- cally used in this treatment adjunct involves placing a patient in a closed chamber with 100% oxygen at two atmospheres of pressure for 2 hours per day for several weeks. The elevated tissue oxygen levels achieved with this technique reach a limited maximum level by the end of therapy, but the effects appear to be long lasting. Spe- cific hyperbaric oxygen protocols vary, however, with some advocating debridement or excision after hyper- baric oxygen therapy.
Bisphosphonate-Related Osteonecrosis
Bisphosphonate Description
Bisphosphonates are stable synthetic analogs of inor- ganic pyrophosphate, a product of many cellular bio- chemical reactions. In the context of bone metabolism, the biological importance of inorganic pyrophosphate lies in its role in the regulation of bone mineralization. Similar to their natural counterpart, bisphosphonates have an affinity for hydroxyapatite crystals and therefore are preferentially taken up by bone. Bisphosphonates have been modified to act primarily as inhibitors of os- teoclast-mediated resorption.
Diseases most commonly treated with these drugs in- clude osteoporosis, Paget’s disease, malignancies that are metastatic to bone (especially breast and prostate cancers), hypercalcemia of malignancy, and multiple myeloma. Other diseases such as fibrous dysplasia, osteogenesis im- perfecta, primary hyperparathyroidism, and giant cell tu- mors of bone have been treated with bisphosphonates with some success. Bisphosphonates are commonly uti- lized for diseases characterized by an imbalance in bone metabolism due to excessive bone resorption. These drugs are therefore used to prevent skeletal events such as patho- logic fracture, hypercalcemia, and spinal cord compression in cancer patients, as well as pathologic fracture in pa- tients with osteoporosis.
Currently prescribed second- and third-generation nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates are markedly more potent than their predecessors (Table 13-3). The most potent drug (zoledronic acid) generally used in cancer

phenomenon. In the latter case, they can alleviate bone pain, help prevent spinal cord compression, and retard pathologic fractures. Although these are palliative effects, some evidence suggests that survival may be improved when bisphosphonates are used as an adjunct to standard anticancer chemotherapy. It has also been suggested that bisphosphonates can inhibit bone loss associated with endocrine therapy in breast and prostate cancers.
Although the benefits of bisphosphonate therapy may be impressive, their use is not without risk (Box 13-4). Many adverse effects have been cited, including esophageal irrita- tion, impairment of renal function, hypocalcemia, fracture due to oversuppression of bone remodeling, cardiac atrial fi- brillation, and osteonecrosis of the jaws. Risk increases with higher drug dosage, longer duration of therapy, greater drug potency, and intravenous (vs. oral) route of administration.
Bisphosphonate-Related Osteonecrosis of the Jaws
Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaws, or BRONJ, has been defined as exposed jawbone for longer than 8 weeks in a patient who has received current or previ- ous treatment with a bisphosphonate medication without evidence of local malignancy or prior radiotherapy to the site (Figure 13-10). Jaw pain is the usual presenting symptom, and exposed bone is the obvious sign. Radiographic

   treatment (multiple myeloma, breast cancer, prostate can- cer, and others), osteoporosis, and Paget’s disease is admin- istered intravenously. Less potent bisphosphonates are predominantly used to treat osteoporosis, as well as other diseases. Bisphosphonate intravenous injection is by far the more efficient route of administration, because absorption from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is less than 5%, while intravenous bisphosphonate administration possesses a high affinity for bone mineral and has shown near 100% bioavailability. Dosing can occur daily, weekly, monthly, or even yearly, depending on drug potency and route of administration. For example, zoledronic acid given intrave- nously for management of osteoporosis can suppress osteo- clastic bone resorption for up to 1 year.
Mechanisms of Action
Bisphosphonates are selectively adsorbed on bony mineral surfaces, where they eventually are taken up by osteoclasts during periods of bone remodeling (resorption). Once in- ternalized, bisphosphonates disrupt intracellular signaling pathways, leading to inhibition of osteoclast function and ultimately to osteoclast apoptosis. It is believed that a simi- lar intracellular signal disruption may occur in some tumor cells, potentially giving bisphosphonates an antitumor ef- fect. Another possible antitumor effect has been linked to a reduction in serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which suppresses tumor angiogenesis. Other cells, such as osteocytes, osteoblasts, monocytes, and some lym- phocytes, appear to be able to internalize bisphosphonates, but with different and apparently less significant effects.
Maximum drug effect is reached within 3 months, ear- lier for intravenous injections. The half-life of bisphospho- nates in the blood is several hours, whereas the half-life in bone is measured in terms of years.
Benefits and Risks of Bisphosphonate Therapy
Bisphosphonates, with their antiosteoclastic activity, help con- trol diseases in which excessive bone resorption is a primary (e.g., osteoporosis) or secondary (e.g., cancer metastasis)

evidence may include sclerosis, sequestrum formation, and nonhealing extraction sockets (Figure 13-11). Periapical dental films or panoramic imaging usually provides suffi- cient evidence of osteonecrosis, although computed tomog- raphy and volumetric cone beam tomography may be useful. Potential sequelae at the site of osteonecrosis include tooth mobility, infection, exudation, sinus/fistulous tract formation, and pathologic fracture. Three clinical stages have been proposed to classify patients and help guide treat- ment. Stage 1 represents patients with exposed bone but no symptoms or evidence of infection; Stage 2 represents pa- tients with exposed bone and associated pain and soft tissue inflammation/infection and Stage 3 represents patients with exposed bone and pain with evidence of soft tissue infection and fistulas and/or pathologic fracture.
Precipitating Events and Risk Factors for Jaw Disease
Most (.90%) cases of osteonecrosis have been associated with intravenous bisphosphonates, usually in cancer patients receiv- ing zoledronic acid or pamidronate. The incidence has been estimated at 1 to 10 per 100 oncology patients receiving intrave- nous bisphosphonates, and between 1 per 10,000 to 100,000 noncancer patients taking oral bisphosphonates. Osteonecrosis can present as early as 1 year after initiation of intravenous drugs, and 3 years after the start of oral drugs, depending on the patient’s medical and dental comorbidities and other medica- tions, and whether surgical trauma of the jaws has occurred.
As expected and likely related to differences in the com- position and vascular perfusion of the jaws, 70% of cases of osteonecrosis have been reported in the mandible. Lesions have been precipitated predominantly by tooth extraction (70%) or other dentoalveolar surgery. Trauma to mucosa overlying bony prominences is a likely precipitating factor. Approximately 10% to 20% of cases of jaw osteonecrosis have been attributed to “spontaneous” events.

include poor oral hygiene, ill-fitting dentures, periodontal disease, and dentoalveolar infections. Contributing sys- temic factors that are believed to be significant in the patho- genesis of this problem include patient medications (cancer chemotherapeutic agents and systemic corticosteroids) that can negatively affect bone metabolism and angiogenesis, obesity, renal dialysis, some systemic diseases (e.g., diabetes mellitus), the cancer itself, metastatic disease, and smoking. Also, increased risk is associated with advancing age.
Treatment of Bisphosphonate-Related Osteonecrosis
of the Jaws
The diagnosis of osteonecrosis is based on history, oral exami- nation, and radiographic imaging. Once confirmed, medical treatment ranges from conservative local measures such as the use of an antimicrobial rinse (such as chlorhexidine) (Stage 1 patients) to the possible use of systemic antibiotics (Stage 2 and 3 patients). This should occur in the context of a meticulous oral hygiene regimen. Surgically, conservative sequestrectomy of necrotic tissue may be of benefit in stage 2 patients. Resec- tion of the affected area may be of considerable value in stage 3 patients. Another therapeutic approach that has some proven benefit is the utilization of hyperbaric oxygen, although addi- tional studies are warranted.
Dental Management of Patients Undergoing Bisphosphonate Therapy
Ideally, patients who are about to begin bisphosphonate therapy should be educated about the potential oral compli- cations of osteonecrosis and the risk factors associated with it. They should be evaluated by a dental professional for caries, periodontal disease, periapical disease, and jaw

lesions. Any disease, including dental impaction, should be addressed/treated at this time. A scrupulous oral hygiene regimen should be initiated and maintained, along with regular recall visits. No contraindication to continuing regular dental care is known for patients on any bisphos- phonate regimen.
If the patient is already on a bisphosphonate regimen, this approach should still be used in an attempt to circum- vent the need for extractions in the future. If dentoalveolar surgery does become necessary, a conservative approach is recommended. Because of the protracted bony half-life of bisphosphonates, stopping the drug regimen to do surgery probably is not necessary. In the event of a periapical cyst/ granuloma, conservative endodontic therapy is recom- mended. Placement of dental implants in patients on bisphosphonate therapy has not been sufficiently studied, although the risk for osteonecrosis seems to be relatively low in patients taking low-potency oral bisphosphonates.

Chronic osteomyelitis with proliferative periostitis, com- monly referred to as Garré’s osteomyelitis, is essentially a subtype of osteomyelitis that has a prominent periosteal inflammatory reaction as an additional component. It most often results from periapical abscess of a mandibular molar
tooth, or from infection associated with tooth extraction or partially erupted molars. It is most common in children.
The eponym Garré’s osteomyelitis was applied to this condition after the author, Dr. C. Garré, described in an 1893 German language paper the clinical features of 72 patients with osteomyelitis. The disease that he de- scribed was most common in the femur, with only three cases occurring in the jaws. In the absence of histologic and radiographic findings, which were unavailable at the time of the report, it is likely that Garré was describing a form of recalcitrant, acute osteomyelitis that occurred in both adults and children. It was not chronic osteomyelitis with proliferative periostitis. Therefore the term Garré’s osteomyelitis, although widely used in reference to this condition, is inaccurate.
Clinical Features
This variety of osteomyelitis is uncommonly encountered. It has been described in the tibia, and in the head and neck area, it is seen in the mandible. It typically involves the posterior mandible and usually is unilateral. Patients char- acteristically present with an asymptomatic bony, hard swelling with normal-appearing overlying skin and mucosa (Figure 13-12, A). On occasion, slight tenderness may be noted. This presentation necessitates differentiation of this process from benign mandibular neoplasms. Radiographs and a biopsy provide a definitive diagnosis.

Radiographically, the lesion appears centrally as a mot- tled, predominantly lucent lesion in a pattern consistent with that of chronic osteomyelitis. The feature that provides the distinctive difference is the periosteal reaction. This, best viewed on an occlusal radiograph, appears as an ex- panded cortex, often with concentric or parallel opaque layers (Figure 13-12, B). Trabeculae perpendicular to the onion-skin layers may also be apparent.
Histopathology
Reactive new bone typifies the subperiosteal cortical response. Perpendicular orientation of new trabeculae to redundant cortical bone is best seen under low magnifica- tion. Osteoblasts dominate in this area, and both osteo- blasts and osteoclasts are seen centrally. Marrow spaces contain fibrous tissue with scattered lymphocytes and plasma cells. Inflammatory cells are often surprisingly scant, making microscopic differentiation from fibro-osseous lesions a diagnostic challenge (Figure 13-12, C and D).
Treatment
Identification and removal of the offending agent are of primary importance in chronic osteomyelitis with prolifera- tive periostitis. Removal of the involved tooth is usually required. Antibiotics are generally included early in this treatment. The mandible then undergoes gradual remodel- ing without additional surgical intervention.
Diffuse Sclerosing Osteomyelitis
Etiology
Diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis represents an inflammatory reaction in the mandible or maxilla, believed to occur in re- sponse to a microorganism of low virulence. Bacteria generally are suspected as causative agents, although they are seldom specifically identified. Chronic periodontal disease, which ap- pears to provide a portal of entry for bacteria, is important in the origin and progression of diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis. Carious nonvital teeth are less often implicated.
Clinical Features
This condition may be seen at any age, in either sex, and in any race, but it tends to occur most often in middle-aged black women. The disease is typified by a protracted chronic course with acute exacerbations of pain, swelling, and occasionally drainage.
Radiographically, this process is diffuse, typically affect- ing a large part of the jaw (Figures 13-13 and 13-14). The lesion is ill defined. Early lucent zones may appear in association with sclerotic masses. In advanced stages, sclerosis dominates the radiographic picture. Periosteal thickening may also be seen. Radiographic scintigraphy using technetium-99m may be particularly useful in eval- uating the extent of this condition.
Histopathology
The microscopic changes of this condition are inflamma- tory. Fibrous replacement of marrow is noted. A chronic

inflammatory cell infiltrate and occasionally a neutrophilic infiltrate are also seen. Bony trabeculae exhibit irregular size and shape and may be lined by numerous osteoblasts. Focal osteoclastic activity is also present. The characteristic scle- rotic masses are composed of dense bone, often exhibiting numerous reversal lines.
Differential Diagnosis
Chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis shares many clinical, radio- graphic, and histologic features with florid osseous dysplasia. The two should be separated, because the former is an inflammatory/infectious process, and the latter is a bony dysplastic process. Treatment and prognosis therefore are different. Florid osseous dysplasia appears to be an extensive form of periapical cemental dysplasia; unlike diffuse scleros- ing osteomyelitis, it may exhibit anterior periapical lesions and traumatic or simple bone cysts. Furthermore, florid osseous dysplasia usually is asymptomatic and appears as a fibro-osseous lesion lacking an inflammatory cell infiltrate.
Treatment
The management of diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis is prob- lematic because of the relatively avascular nature of affected tissue, and because of the large size of the lesion. Even with aggressive treatment, the course is protracted.
If a causative factor such as periodontal disease or a carious tooth can be identified, it should be eliminated. Antibiotics, the mainstay of treatment, are especially help- ful during painful exacerbations. Surgical removal of the diseased area is usually an inappropriate procedure because of the extent of the disease. However, decortication of the affected site has resulted in improvement in some cases. Low-dose corticosteroids have also been used with some success. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy may prove to be a valu- able adjunct. Treatment with pamidronate has shown promising results.

Focal Sclerosing Osteitis
Etiology
Focal sclerosing osteitis is a relatively common phenomenon that is believed to represent a focal bony reaction to a low- grade inflammatory stimulus. It usually is seen at the apex of a tooth with long-standing pulpitis. This lesion occasionally may be adjacent to a sound, unrestored tooth, suggesting that other causative factors such as malocclusion may be operative.
Synonyms for focal sclerosing osteitis include focal scle- rosing osteomyelitis, bony scar, condensing osteitis, and sclerotic bone. The term focal periapical osteopetrosis has also been used to describe idiopathic lesions associated with normal, caries-free teeth.
Clinical Features
Focal sclerosing osteitis may be found at any age but typically is discovered in young adults. Patients usually are asymptom- atic, and most lesions are discovered on routine radiographic examination. Most lesions are found at the apices of mandibular first molars, and a minority are associated with mandibular second molars and premolars (Figure 13-15). When teeth are extracted, these lesions remain behind indefinitely (Figure 13-16).
• Figure 13-15 Focal sclerosing osteitis at the apex of the first molar.
• Figure 13-16 Focal sclerosing osteitis. Residual after tooth extraction.
Radiographically, one of several patterns may be seen (Figure 13-17). The lesion may be uniformly opaque, it may have peripheral lucency with an opaque center, it may have an opaque periphery with a lucent center, or it may be composed of confluent or lobulated opaque masses.
Histopathology
Microscopically, the lesions are masses of dense sclerotic bone. Connective tissue is scant, as are inflammatory cells.
Differential Diagnosis
Differential diagnosis should include periapical cemental dysplasia, osteoma, complex odontoma, cementoblastoma, osteoblastoma, and hypercementosis. In most cases, how- ever, diagnosis can be made with confidence on the basis of historical and radiographic features.
Treatment
Because it is believed to represent a physiologic bone reac- tion to a known stimulus, the lesion itself need not be removed. A biopsy might be contemplated to rule out more

significant lesions that received serious consideration in the differential diagnosis. The inflamed pulp that stimulated the focal sclerosing osteomyelitis should be treated. The decision about whether the tooth should be restored, treated endodontically, or extracted should be made on a case-by-case basis according to findings.

Osteosarcoma of the Jaws
 Malignant nonodontogenic tumors of the jaws, both pri- mary and metastatic, are rare in comparisons of soft tissue and mucosal malignancies. Despite their infrequent occur- rence, the recognition and diagnosis of a malignant jaw tumor is important since these tumors have serious prog- nostic implications and often require oncologic surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy. Generally, there are several signs and symptoms that are highly suggestive of malig- nancy (Box 14-1). Tumors discussed in this chapter are those arising from the hard tissues (osteosarcoma and chon- drosarcoma) and those nonosseous tumors that frequently involve the mandible and the maxilla (Ewing’s sarcoma, Burkitt’s lymphoma, plasma cell malignancies, and meta- static carcinoma).
Osteosarcoma
Osteosarcomas account for approximately 20% of all sar- comas and, after plasma cell neoplasias, are the most com- mon primary bone tumors. The most common sites for osteosarcoma are the long bones, but approximately 5% occur in the jaws, with an incidence of less than 1 case in 1.5 million persons per year (Box 14-2). Osteosarcomas can arise de novo or in the setting of several preexisting

bone abnormalities, such as Paget’s disease, fibrous dyspla- sia, multiple osteochondromas, bone infarct, chronic os- teomyelitis, and osteogenesis imperfecta. Osteosarcoma can also arise in two cancer susceptibility syndromes: he- reditary retinoblastoma (Rb) and Li-Fraumeni syndrome. There are both inherited and acquired forms of Rb. In the hereditary form, patients inherit a mutated allele of the retinoblastoma gene (chromosome 13q14.1-q14.2) and then develop a second postnatal mutation of the other

Malignancies of the Jaws
retinoblastoma allele resulting in retinoblastoma in the eye. This so-called “two-hit hypothesis” was a statistical model proposed by Alfred Knudson in 1971 to explain how in- herited retinoblastoma occurs at an early age, but the non- inherited (acquired) form occurs in older adults. Affected patients with the inherited form have a sixfold increased risk of several sarcomas such as osteosarcoma later in life; patients with the acquired form of Rb do not have an in- creased risk of second cancers later in life. Patients with the rare Li-Fraumeni syndrome inherit a germline mutation of the p53 gene on chromosome 17p13.1 and thereby have an increased risk of developing a variety of tumors including osteosarcomas, breast cancers, brain tumors, and leuke- mias. A second form of Li-Fraumeni syndrome is caused by a mutation of the CHEK2 gene mapped to chromosome 1q23. Irradiation of several bone conditions can lead to the development of osteosarcomas; for example, tumors can develop 10 to 15 years after 40 to 60 Gy of radiation expo- sure to a bone for unrelated or antecedent disease, such as fibrous dysplasia. Osteosarcomas can also be classified by their site of origin as (1) the conventional type, arising within the medullary cavity; (2) juxtacortical tumors, aris- ing from the periosteal surface; and (3) extraskeletal osteo- sarcomas, arising in soft tissue.
Osteosarcomas are characterized by complex structural and numeric chromosomal rearrangements, but show few consistent genetic changes and no specific genetic altera- tion that may be a molecular therapeutic target. Copy number gains at chromosomes 1p, 1q, 6p, 8q, and 17p have been described as well as copy number losses at chro- mosomes 3q, 6q, 9, 10, 13, 17p, and 18q. Mutational in- activation of p53 is seen in up to 20% of high-grade spo- radic osteosarcomas. Alterations of chromosome 8q have been described including a gain of c-myc (chromosome 8q24.21) in many tumors. Parosteal and other low-grade osteosarcomas are characterized by almost invariable am- plification of MDM2 (chromosome 12q13-q14), often along with CDK4 located in the same chromosome region. Chromosome 12q13-q15 amplification products have also been found within supernumerary ring chromosomes of low-grade osteosarcoma. Immunohistochemistry for the nuclear overexpression of MDM2 and CDK4 is a useful tool to assist in differentiating low-grade osteosarcomas from benign mimics.
Clinical Features
Similar to their counterpart in the long bones, conven- tional osteosarcomas involving the mandible and maxilla display a slight predilection for males (60%). Although the peak incidence of osteosarcoma of the skeleton occurs in the second decade, cases arising in the jaws generally present one to two decades later, with a mean age of 35 years (range, 8-85 years). About 10% of osteosarcomas of the jaws occur in persons older than 60 years of age; more than half of these individuals have some underlying bone condition such as Paget’s disease. The mandible is more commonly affected than the maxilla by a ratio of 1.7 to 1. A majority (60%) of mandibular osteosarcomas arise in
the body of the mandible; other common sites include the symphysis, angle of the mandible, ascending ramus, and temporomandibular joint. A nearly equal incidence of tumors involving the alveolar ridge and maxillary an- trum is found in the maxilla, with few cases affecting the palate.
The most common presentation of jaw osteosarcoma is localized pain and swelling and in some cases, loosening and displacement of teeth may occur. Paresthesia, fre- quently a cardinal sign of malignancy, is caused by compres- sion or infiltration of adjacent nerves by tumor. Maxillary tumors display similar clinical symptoms but may also cause epistaxis, nasal obstruction, or eye problems such as proptosis and diplopia. Mucosal ulceration usually is not seen until late-stage disease. The average duration of symp- toms before diagnosis is 3 to 4 months.
The radiographic appearance of conventional (intramed- ullary) osteosarcoma is variable, reflecting the irregular tumor growth pattern, the effect on adjacent normal struc- tures, and the amount of calcification within the tumor. There appears to be little relationship between the radio- graphic pattern and the histologic subtype of osteosarcoma. Early osteosarcomas that involve the alveolar process may be characterized by localized widening of the periodontal ligament space of one or two teeth (Figures 14-1 and 14-2). The widened space results from tumor invasion of the periodontal ligament and resorption of surrounding alveo- lar bone (Figure 14-3). Advanced tumors can appear as “moth-eaten” radiolucencies or as irregular, poorly margin- ated radiopacities. Most of these neoplasms have mixed radiographic features. A characteristic “sunray” or “sunburst” radiopaque appearance due to periosteal reaction may be seen in jaw lesions but is not diagnostic of osteosarcoma (Figures 14-4 and 14-5).
Histopathology
Microscopically, all osteosarcomas have in common a sarcomatous (malignant spindle cell) stroma that directly

produces osteoid (Figures 14-6 and 14-7). Histologic sub- types are recognized and have been designated as chondro- blastic when formed malignant cartilage predominates (most common) (Figure 14-8), osteoblastic when malig- nant bone and osteoid predominate, and fibroblastic when spindle cells predominate (Figure 14-9). An additional variant, designated as telangiectatic, contains multiple blood-filled aneurysmal spaces lined by malignant cells but rarely occurs in the head and neck region. Some osteo- sarcomas contain multinucleated giant cells so plentiful that this form may be mistaken for a central giant cell granuloma.
Central low-grade osteosarcoma is a rare variant, ac- counting for 1% of all osteosarcomas, that may involve the jaws. Microscopically, it resembles fibrous dysplasia because of the minimally atypical spindle cell proliferation with oc- casional mitotic figures and bone spicules. The microscopic diagnosis poses a challenge because of its deceptively bland features. Unlike fibrous dysplasia, the radiographic appear- ance is poorly marginated with cortical disruption, variable mineralization, and with absent margin sclerosis. Also unlike fibrous dysplasia, the proliferation permeates bone marrow, may extend through the periosteum, and may in- vade soft tissues. Immunohistochemistry for the nuclear

expression of MDM2 and CDK4 proteins may help estab- lish the diagnosis. Recurrent tumor or long-standing low-grade osteosarcoma may transform to conventional high-grade osteosarcoma (Figure 14-10).
All histologic variants of conventional osteosarcoma reflect the multipotentiality of neoplastic mesenchymal cells in producing osteoid, cartilage, and fibrous tissue (see

earlier). Such histologic subclassification, however, bears no prognostic significance. Attempts to further grade conven- tional intramedullary osteosarcomas are often problematic because of the heterogeneity of tumor morphology and, with the exception of central low-grade osteosarcoma, have proved to have little prognostic value.
Differential Diagnosis
Uniform widening of the periodontal ligament space of involved teeth appears to be characteristic of early osteosar- coma that involves the alveolus. However, this focal radio- graphic defect may also be seen with other malignancies surrounding the teeth. Uniform widening of periodontal

Malignancies of the Jaws
ligament spaces surrounding all teeth may be seen in sclero- derma. Moth-eaten radiolucencies are common to other malignancies, chronic osteomyelitis, and several benign neoplasms. A sclerotic radiographic appearance of osteosar- coma may be seen in other entities such as metastatic carci- noma (particularly prostatic carcinoma) and may only be differentiated by biopsy.
The histologic diagnosis hinges on the identification of malignant spindle cells producing osteoid. Many jaw osteo- sarcomas are predominantly chondroblastic and may be misdiagnosed as chondrosarcoma if the lesion is not ade- quately sampled at biopsy. Osteosarcoma with a predomi- nant fibroblastic component may be misdiagnosed as fibrous dysplasia, fibrosarcoma, or another pleomorphic sarcoma of bone.
Management
Management of sarcomas of the facial skeleton involves combinations of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Surgical management of osteosarcoma of the mandible, however, is the mainstay of therapy and possesses numerous characteristics similar to the management of carcinoma of the jaw, with some notable differences. These similarities include required attention to surrounding anatomic barriers with their appropriate sacrifice (Figure 14-11). Invasion of anatomic barriers surrounding any head and neck tumor may be assessed by physical examination and/or special imaging studies. When a small sarcoma originates within the medullary component of the mandible, cortical bone is the first anatomic barrier the tumor encounters that fore- stalls its growth. Once the cortical bone is violated, the less

robust periosteum is subsequently encountered. With con- tinued growth, muscle, mucosa, and skin ultimately be- come invaded by the malignancy. The general approach to malignant tumor surgery of the head and neck is that at least one uninvolved anatomic barrier margin should be included on the tumor specimen as part of the en bloc re- section. This practice allows better analysis of tumor mar- gins. The main difference between resection of carcinoma in bone and resection of sarcoma lies in the recommended linear bony margin. Whereas carcinomas may be resected with a 2-cm linear margin in bone, it generally is recom- mended that sarcoma resections should include a 3-cm margin. Attention to proper anatomic barrier sacrifice, as well as inclusion of the recommended linear bony margin, enhances the potential for long-term palliation or cure of patients with sarcoma of the jaw.
Although sarcomas most commonly are managed surgi- cally, it is now recognized that chemotherapy plays an important role in some patients with these tumors. Chemo- therapy may be administered preoperatively (neoadjuvant chemotherapy) or postoperatively (adjuvant chemother- apy). In fact, it has been a time-honored protocol to strongly consider the administration of neoadjuvant che- motherapy in most of these patients, and the administra- tion of adjuvant chemotherapy in all of these patients. One study examined the effects of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on histology of the tumor following this therapy. Neoadju- vant chemotherapy was utilized in 30 of 44 patients with osteosarcoma of the head and neck. The histologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was classified as unfavorable in 22 of 30 patients (73%). An unfavorable response was one in which little or no response to chemotherapy oc- curred, or in which tumors had areas of acellular tumor osteoid and necrotic and/or fibrotic material attributable to the effects of chemotherapy in the background of viable tumor. By contrast, a favorable response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was one with predominant areas of acellular tumor osteoid, necrosis, and/or fibrotic material with only scattered foci of histologically viable tumor cells, or no areas of histologically viable tumor following chemotherapy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was not found to significantly improve local control, distant metastases, or recurrence-free survival. This notwithstanding, when a favorable response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was observed histologically, improved local recurrence-free survival, distant recurrence- free survival, and overall recurrence-free survival were real- ized. Therefore administration of neoadjuvant chemother- apy may be recommended for patients with high-grade osteosarcoma of the head and neck, or for whom initial resection is likely to incur the risk of positive surgical margins or a poor functional result.
The administration of adjuvant chemotherapy is perhaps as controversial as the administration of neoadjuvant che- motherapy, and certainly is contested to a similar degree. Of particular note is the observation of the National Cancer Database that no difference in 5-year survival rates is seen between patients treated with surgery and adjuvant
chemotherapy and those treated with just surgery for osteo- sarcoma of the head and neck. Nonetheless, it is common practice for patients to receive adjuvant chemotherapy following resection of most sarcomas of the head and neck. However, the most favorable prognostic index in this cohort of patients is the attainment of negative surgical margins.
Most studies indicate that intramedullary sarcomas of the jawbones show no response to radiation therapy. The principles of management of sarcoma of the jaw are consis- tent for all subtypes of sarcoma. Moreover, management of all variants of osteosarcoma, including low-grade osteosar- coma, postradiation osteosarcoma, intramedullary osteosar- coma, and juxtacortical osteosarcoma, is identical. Studies demonstrate that conservative management of those sarco- mas with an otherwise inherently better prognosis than the others will lead to local recurrence and will increase the tendency toward distant metastasis. These two scenarios are associated with greatly diminished survival rates, thereby justifying aggressive surgical management from the outset.
Prognosis
Overall, 5-year survival rates of 25% to 40% are reported for jaw osteosarcoma. Patients with mandibular tumors generally fare better than those with maxillary tumors. As with most malignant jaw tumors, initial radical surgery re- sults in a superior survival rate of 80% compared with a 25% survival rate with local or conservative surgery. Osteo- sarcoma of the jaw commonly recurs (40%-70%), with a metastatic rate of 25% to 50%. Osteosarcomas are more likely to metastasize to lung and to brain than to regional lymph nodes. Once the disease has become metastatic, the mean survival time is 6 months. Nearly 80% of patients who die of the disease do so within the first 2 years. Local recurrences and isolated metastatic deposits are treated by surgical excision and chemotherapy.
Juxtacortical Osteosarcoma
In contrast to conventional (intramedullary) osteosarcomas, juxtacortical (parosteal and periosteal) osteosarcomas arise at the periphery of bone at the periosteal surface, with dis- tinct clinical, histologic, and radiographic features, as well as different biological behaviors. Juxtacortical osteosarco- mas are uncommon neoplasms that account for approxi- mately 5% of all osteosarcomas of the skeleton; they are rarely seen in the jaw. Most juxtacortical osteosarcomas aris- ing in the jaw are of the biologically low-grade parosteal subtype or rarely, the periosteal subtype.
Parosteal Osteosarcoma
Parosteal osteosarcoma occurs over a wide age range, with a peak incidence at 39 years (Figures 14-12 and 14-13). More than 95% of cases affect the long bones, most commonly the distal femoral metaphysis, and at these sites there is a female predominance (3 to 2); when the jaws are affected,

there is a male predominance. The tumor typically presents as a long-standing, slow-growing, swelling or palpable mass, often accompanied by a dull, aching sensation. Radio- graphically, the tumor often is radiodense (radiopaque) and is attached to the external surface of bone by a broad sessile base. It often is more radiodense at the base than at the periphery. The broad pedicle is not continuous radiograph- ically with the underlying marrow cavity. A radiolucent clear space, corresponding to the periosteum, often can be identified between the tumor and the underlying cortex.
Histologically, parosteal osteosarcomas are well differen- tiated and are characterized by a spindle cell stroma with minimal atypia and rare mitotic figures separating irregular
trabeculae of woven bone (Figure 14-14). The periphery is less ossified than the base; the lesion may have a lobulated cartilaginous cap, or it may be irregular because of linear extensions into soft tissue. Medullary involvement is un- usual at initial presentation, but approximately 20% of tumors, especially recurrent ones, exhibit invasion of the underlying bone. This does not seem to affect the prognosis adversely. The bland histologic appearance of parosteal os- teosarcoma raises the possibility of osteoma, osteochon- droma, and exostosis.
Periosteal Osteosarcoma
Periosteal osteosarcoma occurs much less often than does parosteal osteosarcoma. It has a 2:1 male predominance and a peak age of occurrence of 20 years. Tumors commonly involve the upper tibial metaphysis. Periosteal osteosarcoma is very rare in the jaw.
The radiographic appearance of periosteal osteosarcoma is distinct from that of parosteal osteosarcoma. The cortex of involved bone is radiographically intact and sometimes is thickened, with no tumor involvement of the underlying marrow cavity. The tumor most often is radiolucent, cor- responding to its predominantly cartilaginous component, and it has a more poorly defined periphery. On occasion, a periosteal reaction in the form of Codman’s triangle (a

radiographic shadow between the raised ends of perios- teum and the cortical bone due to reactive bone formation) may be noted, along with variably sized perpendicular cal- cified spicules of bone radiating from the cortex. Overall, the periosteal osteosarcoma tumor matrix is not as radio- graphically dense or homogeneous as that of the parosteal osteosarcoma.
Microscopically, periosteal osteosarcoma is composed of lobules of poorly differentiated malignant cartilage; it often shows central ossification. The malignant cartilage and oste- oid appear to radiate from an intact cortex. The osteoid present in this variant is fine and lacelike, and it is found in the chondroid islands among intervening malignant spindle cells. These histologic features can be identical to those of intramedullary osteosarcoma; therefore radiographic corre- lation is necessary to make the diagnosis. Malignant cyto- logic features also distinguish this variant of juxtacortical osteosarcoma from the parosteal type. In periosteal osteo- sarcoma, minimal tumor infiltration into cortical bone is typical without medullary involvement. This feature helps differentiate this lesion from a chondroblastic intramedul- lary osteosarcoma that has permeated the cortex and formed a soft tissue mass.
Juxtacortical osteosarcomas must be completely removed by en bloc resection or by radical excision. A significant lo- cal recurrence rate can be expected if the underlying cortical bone is not removed with these lesions. The overall 5-year survival rate for juxtacortical osteosarcoma of the skeleton is 80%. In one series of juxtacortical osteosarcomas, pulmo- nary metastases developed in 13% of patients with parosteal osteosarcomas, and in 22% of those with periosteal osteo- sarcomas. Overall, the survival rate for juxtacortical osteo- sarcomas is better than that for conventional intramedullary osteosarcomas. However, it is not known whether juxtacor- tical osteosarcomas of the jaws are substantially different in biological behavior from those occurring in long bones. Meaningful conclusions comparing the treatment and prognosis of parosteal and periosteal osteosarcomas in the jaws cannot be made because of the few reported cases and the various methods of treatment used (curettage, local excision, and radical resection).
Chondrosarcoma
Chondrosarcoma is the third most common bone malig- nancy after myeloma and osteosarcoma. Most occur in the 30 to 60 year age group with 75% arising in men. About 15% occur in patients who are under the age of 20 years and these may be higher grade. In the mandible and maxilla they are rare, accounting for only approximately 1% of chondrosarcoma arising in the skeleton. The appearance of benign cartilaginous tumors in the jaws is also rare. The microscopic distinction between a benign chondroma and a low-grade chondrosarcoma is often challenging and not well defined, and clinical experience dictates that well- differentiated chondrogenic neoplasms in the jaws should be viewed with a high index of suspicion for malignancy.
Chondrosarcoma most commonly arises de novo, but sec- ondary chondrosarcoma arising in preexisting benign carti- laginous lesions such as osteochondroma or enchondroma is recognized but exceptionally rare. Patients affected by the rare nonhereditary disorders of Maffucci’s syndrome and Ollier’s disease have a significant risk of developing visceral, brain, and skeletal malignancies including chondrosarcoma. Maffucci’s syndrome is characterized by multiple enchon- dromas and multiple hemangiomas. Patients with Ollier’s disease also have multiple enchondromas, but without hemangiomas, and their risk of malignancy is lower than in patients with Maffucci’s syndrome.
Clinical Features
Chondrosarcomas more often involve the maxillofacial area (60%) than the mandible (40%). Lesions arising in the maxilla usually involve the anterior region (lateral incisor– canine region) and the palate. Mandibular chondrosarco- mas occur most often in the premolar and molar regions, symphysis, and coronoid process, and occasionally in the condylar process. There is no distinct gender predilection. Chondrosarcomas predominate in adulthood and old age. Although the mean age of occurrence of chondrosarcoma is 60 years, almost half of jaw lesions have arisen in the third and fourth decades of life.
The most common signs are painless swelling and expan- sion of affected bones, resulting in loosening of teeth or ill-fitting dentures. Pain, visual disturbances, nasal signs, and headache may result from extension of chondrosar- coma from the jaw to contiguous structures.
The radiographic appearance of chondrosarcoma varies from moth-eaten radiolucencies that are solitary or multilocular to diffusely opaque lesions (Figure 14-15). Many chondrosarcomas contain mottled densities cor- responding to areas of calcification and ossification.
• Figure 14-15 Chondrosarcoma of the anterior maxilla.

336 CHAPTER 14
Malignancies of the Jaws
Localized widening of the periodontal ligament space may also be seen in chondrosarcoma. Computed tomog- raphy (CT) visualization of cartilaginous neoplasms is the preferred method to image chondrosarcoma, particu- larly to assess the peripheral extent of the tumor, com- pared with panoramic or other plain radiographs. A multilocular radiographic appearance may suggest a dif- ferential diagnosis of ameloblastoma, central giant cell granuloma, odontogenic myxoma, and odontogenic keratocyst, whereas other patterns may suggest meta- static carcinoma, osteosarcoma, and calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor.
Histopathology
The histologic appearance of chondrosarcoma is variable and there are several variants (Figure 14-16). Most tumors arising in the jaws are well differentiated. Grade I (well differentiated) chondrosarcomas often have a lobular architecture; they range from proliferations resembling benign cartilage to those with increased numbers of chondrocytes in a chondroid to myxomatous stroma. Grade II (intermediate) tumors often have a myxoid stroma with enlarged chondrocyte nuclei displaying oc- casional mitotic figures. Increased cellularity is often noted at the periphery of the cartilaginous lobules. Grade III (poorly differentiated) chondrosarcomas are markedly cellular, often with a spindle cell component. Mitotic figures may be numerous. The prognostic significance of the pathologic grading of chondrosarcomas is well es- tablished. The 5-year survival rate for well-differentiated tumors is 78%, for intermediate-grade 53%, and for poorly- differentiated tumors 22%. Distant metastases occur in 4% of well-differentiated, 10% in intermediate-grade, and in 70% of high-grade tumors.
Differential Diagnosis
The microscopic differential diagnosis of chondrosarcoma may include benign chondroma, which is rare in the jaws and should be considered only if the lesion is a small inci- dental finding. The histology more commonly evokes the
• Figure 14-16 Chondrosarcoma showing a sheet of atypical cartilage.
possibility of the chondroblastic variant of osteosarcoma, which accounts for nearly 50% of osteosarcomas in the jaw. This latter entity is recognized when adequate tissue sam- pling reveals foci of malignant osteoid formation. In addi- tion, chondroid areas of pleomorphic adenoma arising in overlying soft tissues may mimic cartilaginous tumors of bone. Chondromyxoid fibroma is a rare, benign neoplasm of bone that may resemble chondrosarcoma because of the presence of large atypical cells; however, it has a distinctly lobulated appearance with a prominent myxoid element and focal calcifications. Synovial chondromatosis involving the temporomandibular joint may also simulate chondro- sarcoma.
Treatment and Prognosis
Because chondrosarcomas are radioresistant neoplasms, wide local or radical surgical excision is the treatment of choice. Therefore, the location of the primary lesion and the adequacy of surgical resection (tumor-free margins) are of prime prognostic significance for chondrosarcoma of the jaw. In addition, the pathologic grade of chondrosarcoma is indicative of its innate biological behavior and propensity for metastasis. The most common cause of death due to chondrosarcoma of the jaw is uncontrolled local recurrence and extension into adjacent vital structures. Metastasis, more common with high-grade chondrosarcoma, is gener- ally to lung or bone. The usual clinical course of chondro- sarcoma is long, with recurrences not uncommonly occur- ring 5 years or even 10 to 20 years after therapy. The 5-year survival rate for chondrosarcoma of the jaws (15%-20%) appears to be poorer than that for chondrosarcoma in other body sites.
Mesenchymal Chondrosarcoma
Mesenchymal chondrosarcoma is a rare form of chondro- sarcoma that is histologically distinct and clinically unique compared with chondrosarcoma arising in bone. Although it can occur at any age, the peak incidence is in the second and third decades.
As many as one third of mesenchymal chondrosarcomas arise in soft tissue. Those that arise in bone show a predilec- tion for the maxilla, mandible, and ribs. In one series of 15 mesenchymal chondrosarcomas of bone, one third occurred in the jaws. Most tumors arise between the ages of 10 and 30 years, with a nearly equal gender distribution. This presentation is distinctly different from other forms of chondrosarcoma that occur in older adults (mean age of 60 years).
Similar to the situation with the other malignant neo- plasms discussed, pain and at times swelling are the usual presenting symptoms. The radiologic appearance is of a lytic lesion that may be ill defined or sharply defined. Most contain stippled or large areas of calcification.
The characteristic histologic appearance of mesenchymal chondrosarcoma is that of an anaplastic small cell malig- nancy containing zones of readily identifiable and often well-formed malignant cartilage. The undifferentiated small cell proliferation resembles Ewing’s sarcoma and often
  
www.konkur.in
displays a hemangiopericytoma-like growth pattern. It has been suggested that the small cell undifferentiated prolifera- tion represents precartilaginous mesenchyme. By immuno- histochemistry the tumors are positive for vimentin, CD57/ Leu7, neuron specific enolase, and CD99/MIC2. There are no specific or recurrent alterations but the translocation der(13;21)(q10:q10) along with loss of all or a portion of chromosomes 8 and 20 and gain of all or a portion of chro- mosome 12 was identified in one skeletal and an extraosse- ous mesenchymal chondrosarcoma.
Appropriate sampling of these tumors demonstrates bi- morphic proliferation of undifferentiated small cells alter- nating with areas of cartilage. The latter finding distinguishes mesenchymal chondrosarcoma from similar-appearing Ewing’s sarcoma, solitary fibrous tumor, and even synovial sarcoma.
Mesenchymal chondrosarcoma is a highly malignant neoplasm that requires wide surgical excision. Similar to other chondrosarcomas, it is relatively radioresistant. The 5-year survival rate is 50%, and the 10-year survival rate is 20%. The prognosis for jaw lesions is somewhat better. In addition to local recurrence, mesenchymal chondrosarco- mas show a significant rate of distant metastases, often to lung and bone. Detection of metastatic disease in survivors may be delayed until 12 to 22 years after treatment of the primary tumor.
Ewing’s Sarcoma and Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumor
The terms Ewing’s sarcoma and primitive neuroectoder- mal tumor (PNET) are often used interchangeably to de- scribe a rare round cell malignancy showing neuroectoder- mal differentiation. Some have suggested using the term Ewing’s sarcoma when the tumor is undifferentiated, or in bone and PNET if there is neural morphology, or it is present in soft tissues. Ewing’s sarcoma is named after the American pathologist James Ewing who first described the tumor in 1921 and separated it from lymphoma and other known forms of cancer at the time. The cause is unknown, the cell of origin uncertain, and even the multipotentiality of antigenic expression controversial. Both Ewing’s sar- coma and PNET have a common chromosome transloca- tion t(11;22)(q24;q12) in approximately 85% of cases. This translocation results in juxtaposition of the EWS and FLI-1 genes. Another translocation, t(21;22)(q22;q12), found in 10% to 15% of cases, fuses the EWS gene to the ERG gene. Ewing’s sarcoma accounts for approximately 6% of all malignant bone tumors. Approximately 4% of Ewing’s sarcomas have arisen in the bones of the head and neck, with 1% occurring in the jaws. Most involve the bones of the lower extremity or pelvis. When the jaws are involved, the predilection is for the ramus of the mandi- ble, with few cases reported in the maxilla. Because Ew- ing’s sarcoma has a propensity to metastasize to other bones, the possibility that jawbone involvement represents metastatic disease from another skeletal site should always be considered.
Clinical Features
Ewing’s sarcoma is rare, accounting for 6% to 10% of pri- mary malignant bone tumors, but it is the second most common sarcoma in bone and soft tissue in children. Ninety percent of Ewing’s sarcomas occur between the ages of 5 and 30 years, and more than 60% affect males. The mean age of occurrence for primary tumors involving bones of the head and neck is 11 years. Pain and swelling are the most common presenting symptoms. Involvement of the mandible or maxilla may result in facial deformity, destruction of alveolar bone with loosening of teeth, and mucosal ulcers. Radiographic findings in the jaws are non- specific and may simulate an infectious or malignant pro- cess (Figure 14-17). The most characteristic appearance is that of a moth-eaten destructive radiolucency of the med- ullary bone and erosion of the cortex with expansion. A variable periosteal onion-skin reaction also may be seen. A significant number of patients also have a soft tissue mass.
Histopathology
With an adequate biopsy specimen, Ewing’s sarcoma is recognized microscopically as a proliferation of uniform, closely packed cells that may be compartmentalized by fi- brous bands. The round to oval nuclei have finely dispersed chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli (Figure 14-18). The

cytoplasm characteristically stains with the periodic acid– Schiff stain but is digested with diastase, indicating the presence of glycogen. Although glycogen staining by this technique is helpful in diagnosis, some otherwise histologi- cally acceptable cases of Ewing’s sarcoma have yielded nega- tive results. In addition, other tumors that mimic Ewing’s sarcoma may contain glycogen. CD99 is highly expressed in most Ewing’s sarcomas and PNETs. Often, cytogenetics to identify the characteristic chromosome translocations are needed to establish the diagnosis.
Differential Diagnosis
Microscopically, Ewing’s sarcoma is so sufficiently undif- ferentiated or anaplastic that its appearance is readily simulated by other so-called small round cell tumors that occur in childhood and adolescence. This differential di- agnosis includes lymphoma/leukemia, metastatic neuro- blastoma, mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, small cell os- teosarcoma, and, although rare for this age group, metastatic carcinoma. Routine light microscopy can be used to discriminate between these similar-appearing neoplasms, but electron microscopy, immunohistochem- istry, and cytogenetics often must be used to reach a conclusive diagnosis. By electron microscopy, the cells of Ewing’s sarcoma are characterized by pools of cytoplasmic glycogen, sparse organelles, and rare primitive intercellu- lar junctions. By immunohistochemistry, all Ewing’s sar- comas contain abundant vimentin intermediate filaments. The presence of other classes of intermediate filaments has been demonstrated in frozen tissue specimens. PNETs and Ewing’s sarcomas lack morphologic evidence of neu- ral morphologic differentiation, but they share a high level of expression of the CD99 antigen. Neural markers such as neuron-specific enolase are also expressed by a high proportion of tumors. By cytogenetic analysis, the t(11;22)(q24;q12) or (21;22)(q22;q12) translocation can be identified.
Treatment and Prognosis
The highly malignant nature of this sarcoma is reflected in its propensity for metastasis, especially to lungs, other bones, and lymph nodes. Multiple-method treatment pro- tocols, involving surgery or radiation for local control and chemotherapy for systemic micrometastases, have dra- matically improved the formerly dismal 10% 5-year sur- vival rate. With these newer intensive therapies, 80% 2-year disease-free survival rates and 60% 5-year actuarial survival rates have been reported. Clinical features associ- ated with a poor prognosis include presentation before age 10 years, the presence of metastatic disease, systemic symptoms, a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, an ele- vated serum lactate dehydrogenase value, and thrombocy- tosis. In addition, the site of involvement appears to be of prognostic significance in Ewing’s sarcomas: Patients with mandibular tumors are noted to have a more favorable overall survival time than those with any other bone site of origin.
Burkitt’s Lymphoma
Burkitt’s lymphoma (see also Chapter 9) is a high-grade non-Hodgkin’s B-cell lymphoma that is endemic in Africa and occurs only sporadically in North America and West- ern Europe. It was first described in 1958 by the surgeon Denis Burkitt as a jaw malignancy occurring with high frequency in African children. By 1961, additional reports demonstrated the distinctive clinical and pathologic fea- tures of this tumor, by then confirmed to be a malignant lymphoma. Subsequently, nonendemic forms of Burkitt’s lymphoma were recognized in the United States. The endemic and sporadic forms of Burkitt’s lymphoma are histologically and immunophenotypically identical. Clini- cal differences exist, however, between the endemic and sporadic forms.
Both sporadic and endemic forms of Burkitt’s lym- phoma are characterized by a translocation of the distal part of chromosome 8 containing the c-myc oncogene to the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene locus on chromosome 14. Two other translocations are recognized, but common to all is involvement of the c-myc gene. These translocations may be directly involved in the enhanced tumor cell prolif- eration of Burkitt’s lymphoma, which has been shown to have one of the highest proliferation rates of any neoplasm in humans, with a potential doubling time of 24 hours and a growth fraction of nearly 100%.
Clinical Features
In Africa, lymphoma accounts for 50% of all childhood malignancies, but it constitutes only 6% to 10% of child- hood malignancies in the United States and Europe. Whereas the endemic form of Burkitt’s lymphoma has a peak incidence between 3 and 8 years of age and a 2:1 male predominance, the sporadic form affects a slightly older age group, with a mean age of 11 years, and has no gender pre- dilection. An overwhelming majority (77%) of cases of sporadic Burkitt’s lymphoma occur in whites.
Endemic Burkitt’s lymphoma typically involves the mandible, maxilla, and abdomen, with extranodal involve- ment of the retroperitoneum, kidneys, liver, ovaries, and endocrine glands. The incidence of jaw tumors in endemic Burkitt’s lymphoma is related to the age of the patient; 88% of those younger than 3 years of age and only 25% of those older than 15 years of age show jaw involvement. Involve- ment of the jaws is relatively uncommon in the sporadic form of this disease, occurring in approximately 10% of cases. Sporadic Burkitt’s lymphoma presents most often as an abdominal mass involving the mesenteric lymph nodes or ileocecal region, often with an intestinal obstruction. Involvement of the retroperitoneum, gonads, and other viscera occurs less often. Although predominantly an extra- nodal disease, involvement of cervical lymph nodes or bone marrow has also been noted. A notable difference between endemic and nonendemic forms of Burkitt’s lymphoma is that the Epstein-Barr virus genome can be detected in 95% of endemic cases but in only 10% of sporadic cases.
  
www.konkur.in
When the mandible and the maxilla are involved, the initial focus is usually in the posterior region, more com- monly in the maxilla than in the mandible (Figure 14-19). Tumors in the sporadic form appear more localized, whereas in the endemic form, they more commonly involve all four quadrants. The usual signs associated with jaw lesions are an expanding intraoral mass and mobility of the teeth. Pain and paresthesia are occasionally present. In addition to a facial mass, in the sporadic disease, toothache is a common complaint, as is paresthesia of the lip. Burkitt’s lymphoma has also been noted to invade the dental pulp, especially in developing teeth. Radiographically, a moth-eaten, poorly marginated destruction of bone is observed (Figure 14-20). The cortex may be expanded, eroded, or perforated, with soft tissue involvement.
Histopathology
Burkitt’s lymphoma is a neoplastic B-cell proliferation that contains cell-surface B-lineage differentiation antigens and monoclonal surface immunoglobulin. The proliferation is extremely monomorphic, composed of medium-sized lym- phocytes with round nuclei and three to five small baso- philic nucleoli. Throughout the lymphoid proliferation are numerous scattered macrophages containing nuclear

debris, contributing to the so-called starry sky appearance (Figure 14-21). By immunohistochemistry, tumor cells express the B-cell markers CD20 and CD10. Almost all the cells are dividing and the almost uniform expression of the proliferation marker Ki-67 protein can be useful in diagnosis. The histologic differential diagnosis includes other subtypes of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, undifferenti- ated carcinoma and sarcoma, metastatic neuroblastoma, and acute leukemia.
Treatment and Prognosis
At one time, Burkitt’s lymphoma was invariably fatal within 4 to 6 months of diagnosis. However, because of its high proliferation rate, Burkitt’s lymphoma has proved to be extremely sensitive to combination chemotherapy, and therefore is potentially curable. The endemic and sporadic forms of Burkitt’s lymphoma show similar excellent re- sponse rates to chemotherapy, with similar rates of relapse and survival. With combination chemotherapy, the overall 2-year survival rate is 55%, with a range of 80% for low- stage disease and 40% for advanced-stage disease.
Plasma Cell Neoplasms
Multiple Myeloma
Plasma cell neoplasms (see also Chapter 9) are derived from bone marrow stem cells of B-lymphocyte lineage, and they are functionally differentiated in their ability to pro- duce and secrete immunoglobulin. Because these tumors are derived from a single neoplastic clone, they are associ- ated with the production of monoclonal immunoglobulin components, with the immunoglobulin light chain re- stricted to the kappa or the lambda type. These tumors may present in soft tissue as extramedullary plasmacytoma, in bone as a solitary lytic lesion known as plasmacytoma of bone, or most commonly, as part of the multifocal dis- seminated disease, multiple myeloma. Eighty percent of extramedullary plasmacytomas involve the head and neck region, with a predilection for the nasopharynx, nasal cav- ity, paranasal sinuses, and tonsils. These tumors have also

been reported in the gingiva, palate, floor of mouth, and tongue. Solitary plasmacytoma of bone is rare in the jaws; it more commonly appears in the ileum, femur, humerus, thoracic vertebrae, and skull. Multiple myeloma is a disease of the hematopoietic marrow–bearing bone of the skele- ton, but 70% to 95% of affected individuals have had radiographic involvement of the bones of the maxilla or mandible (Box 14-3).
Clinical Features
Rarely encountered before the fifth decade of life, multiple myeloma appears at a mean age of 63 years. It has a slight male predominance. Involvement of the jaws may be asymptomatic or may produce pain, swelling, expansion, numbness, mobility of teeth, or pathologic fracture. Rarely is there an associated soft tissue mass. Some patients may exhibit weakness, weight loss, anemia, and hyperviscosity syndromes. Approximately 10% of patients with multiple myeloma develop systemic amyloidosis, a condition associ- ated with other systemic diseases (Box 14-4) (see also discussion on multiple myeloma in Chapter 9). Eighty- five percent of patients with multiple myeloma have ab- normal results on a skeletal radiographic survey. Although remaining patients have an apparently normal radio- graphic series, they demonstrate plasmacytosis on marrow aspirate or a biopsy specimen.

The most common peripheral blood abnormality is ane- mia with rouleaux (stacks of red blood cells) formation and, rarely, circulating plasma cells. The production of monoclo- nal immunoglobulin components by neoplastic plasma cells results in an excess of abnormal protein that circulates in serum and often can be detected in urine. On serum pro- tein electrophoresis, most patients with myeloma are found to have a decreased quantity of normal immunoglobulin and an abnormal monoclonal immunoglobulin protein peak, known as an M spike. The immunoglobulin is usually of the immunoglobulin (Ig)G or IgA class, with a monoclo- nal light chain component. Some plasma cell neoplasms may secrete only a monoclonal light chain. These monoclo- nal immunoglobulin components can be demonstrated by immunoelectrophoresis of both serum and urine in approxi- mately 95% of patients with myeloma. Urinary monoclonal light chains, so-called Bence Jones proteinuria, may be de- tected in approximately 50% of patients with myeloma. Two percent of myeloma cases are nonsecretory, although mono- clonal immunoglobulin may be demonstrated within plasma cell cytoplasm by the immunoperoxidase method.
The radiographic appearance of myeloma can vary. Typically seen are multiple sharply punched-out but non- corticated radiolucent areas of bone destruction in the jaws and in many of the hematopoietic marrow-containing bones of the skeleton (Figures 14-22 and 14-23). Plasma

cell tumors in the jaws may be expansile, and on rare occa- sions, may be osteosclerotic. The finding of a solitary plasma cell tumor in the jaw more often is a manifestation of systemic disease than a manifestation of a solitary plasmacytoma of bone.
Histopathology
Microscopically, all clinical manifestations of plasma cell tumors are similar. Tumors are composed of a monotonous proliferation of neoplastic plasma cells that may display a wide range of differentiation, from mature-appearing plasma cells to less well-differentiated forms resembling immunoblastic large cell lymphomas. Abundant plasma cells within bone marrow can be distinguished from the plasma cells of chronic osteomyelitis or periapical granu- loma by the associated proliferation of small vessels and fibroblasts with admixed neutrophils and macrophages in the reactive lesions. In addition, a monoclonal population of CD79a1 or CD1381 cells expressing only one of the two immunoglobulin light chains (kappa or lambda) can be demonstrated using immunohistochemistry or by in situ hybridization methods. This is referred to as light chain restriction. A non-neoplastic population of plasma cells will contain a population of kappa to lambda express- ing cells ranging from 3:1 to 1:1 (Figure 14-24).
Differential Diagnosis
Although the punched-out lytic appearance is characteris- tic, the radiographic differential diagnosis of these jaw lesions includes other malignant neoplasms of the jaws, such as metastatic carcinoma, lymphoma, and Langerhans cell disease. Therefore, diagnosis must be confirmed by a biopsy specimen or aspirate. Histologically, very poorly differenti- ated plasma cell neoplasms may simulate other relatively undifferentiated malignant neoplasms, such as lymphoma, leukemia, undifferentiated carcinoma, metastatic malignant melanoma, and neuroblastoma. These entities can be distin- guished by immunoperoxidase detection of the leukocyte common antigen in lymphomas/leukemias, cytokeratin in
carcinomas, S-100 protein, melanoma-associated antigens in melanoma, and neuron-specific enolase in neuroblastoma. Plasma cell tumors do not express these antigens, but they express CD79a and CD138.
Treatment and Prognosis
Most patients with myeloma die of infection or less com- monly, renal failure, disseminated myeloma, cardiac compli- cations, or hematologic complications of hemorrhage or thrombosis. Multiple myeloma is treated with chemothera- peutic alkylating agents and steroids and with local radiation directed to painful bone lesions. Other therapeutic regimens (none curative) have included combination chemotherapy, bone marrow transplantation, the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, and thalidomide (or analogs). Bisphosphonates are often added to prevent bone fracture. The overall median survival time is related to the stage of disease and ranges from longer than 60 months in patients with low stage I disease to 23 months in those presenting with high stage III disease. Indicators of prognosis correlate with the myeloma cell burden and include hemoglobin level, serum calcium level, serum and urine M-component, degree of bone in- volvement, and creatinine levels indicative of renal failure.
Solitary Plasmacytoma of Bone
Similar to multiple myeloma, solitary plasmacytoma of bone is a disease of adulthood, with a mean age of 50 years at presentation and predominance in men. Solitary plasma- cytomas rarely occur in the jaws, but when they do, they are often located in the angle of the mandible. For a diagnosis of solitary plasmacytoma to be established, a radiologic bone survey and random bone marrow aspirate and biopsy specimen should reveal no evidence of plasmacytosis in other areas of the body. However, 30% to 75% of cases of solitary plasmacytoma of bone eventually progress to mul- tiple myeloma. It is not possible to predict which patients will develop disseminated disease and which will not. As with multiple myeloma, the clinical symptoms include pain, swelling, and pathologic fracture.

Malignancies of the Jaws
Radiographically, solitary plasmacytoma is a well-defined lytic lesion that may be multilocular, resembling the appear- ance of central giant cell granuloma. Solitary plasmacyto- mas may destroy the cortical bone and spread into adjacent soft tissue. Unlike those with multiple myeloma, patients with solitary plasmacytoma of bone have a normal periph- eral blood picture and a normal differential and clinical chemistry profile. A monoclonal immunoglobulin can be demonstrated in serum or urine in 25% of cases of solitary plasmacytoma of bone. Biopsy material of solitary plasma- cytoma of bone reveals a histologic appearance identical to that of multiple myeloma, with a monotonous proliferation of neoplastic plasma cells producing monoclonal immuno- globulin components.
Solitary plasmacytoma of bone is treated primarily by local radiotherapy. Accessible lesions may be surgically ex- cised, followed by radiation therapy. Ten percent to 15% of patients have local recurrence of the solitary plasmacytoma, and small numbers of patients may develop an additional solitary plasmacytoma of bone. Although a significant proportion of cases progress to multiple myeloma, the over- all survival time of patients with solitary plasmacytoma is 10 years, in contrast to the 20-month mean survival time of patients initially diagnosed with multiple myeloma. This appears to indicate that many solitary plasmacytomas are biologically low-grade, but slowly progressive, forms of multiple myeloma.
Metastatic Carcinoma
The most common malignancy affecting skeletal bones is metastatic carcinoma. However, metastatic disease to the mandible and maxilla is unusual; it is estimated that 1% of malignant neoplasms metastasize to these sites (Box 14-5). Approximately 80% of these metastases are to the mandible, 14% to the maxilla, and 5% to both jaws. Occasionally, metastatic deposits are seen in the gingiva with a clinical appearance that simulates pyogenic granuloma. In adults, metastases to the jaws most commonly originate from pri- mary carcinoma of the breast in women and of the lung in men. Other common primary sites in decreasing order of frequency are the prostate, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, colon, and rectum. In children, neuroblastoma of adrenal glands is the most common primary site in the first decade of life, but bone malignancies are the most common primary site in the second decade of life. Jawbone metastasis may be the first sign of malignancy in as many as 30% of cases.

Clinical Features
Individuals likely to be affected by metastatic carcinoma to the jaws are in the older age groups, most in the fifth to sev- enth decades of life, with an average age of 45 years, reflecting the greater prevalence of malignancy in this population. The mechanism of spread to the jaws is usually hematogenous from the primary visceral neoplasm or from lung metastases. Within the jaw, the premolar-molar region, the angle, and the body of the mandible are more commonly involved by metastatic disease (Figures 14-25 to 14-27). Bone pain, loos- ening of teeth, lip paresthesia, bone swelling, gingival mass, and pathologic fracture may be clinically evident.
Most jaw metastases appear radiographically as poorly marginated, radiolucent defects. Some metastatic carcino- mas, notably prostate and thyroid, are characterized by an

osteoblastic process. Although the appearance of osteomyeli- tis is of a moth-eaten radiolucency, it rarely expands the corti- cal bone and typically shows a periosteal reaction.
Histopathology
The histologic appearance of metastatic carcinoma can be extremely variable, reflecting the tumor type and grade of tumor differentiation (Figures 14-28 to 14-30).
• Figure 14-29 Metastatic renal clear cell carcinoma excised from a periapical radiolucency.
A prominent desmoplastic stromal response is often present. The diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma can be verified in difficult cases with an immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratin, which is present in all carci- noma cells. Through immunohistochemistry, antibodies to tumor type-specific antigens that are reactive in for- malin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material and capable of pointing to a primary site in the prostate, lung, breast, colon, or kidney are becoming increasingly available. Dif- ferential expression of cytokeratins 7 and 20 (CK7, CK20, respectively) and villin may also be useful (Table 14-1) in establishing the origin of a metastatic primary carcinoma when the primary is not known. Other examples include identification of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in a carci- noma, suggesting a nasopharynx primary, and human papillomavirus (HPV)16 in a basaloid carcinoma, sug- gesting an oropharynx (tonsil) primary. It is anticipated that with advances in monoclonal antibody develop- ment, this technique will be very useful in identifying carcinomas of unknown metastatic origin.
Differential Diagnosis
The differential diagnosis of intrabony, poorly differentiated carcinoma includes anaplastic sarcoma, lymphoma, and

  amelanotic melanoma. The very rare primary intraosseous carcinoma of probable odontogenic origin is considered in Chapter 11. The presence of cytokeratin within the tumor cells is diagnostic of carcinoma. Immunoperoxidase stains for the leukocyte common antigen verify a diagnosis of lymphoma/leukemia, whereas immunoreactivity with mel- anoma-associated antigens and S-100 protein indicates a diagnosis of melanoma. Although many of these sophisti- cated diagnostic techniques can be used to identify the nature of an anaplastic neoplasm, there is no substitute for an accurate medical history and physical examination, espe- cially in the diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma.
Osteonecrosis Related to Metastatic Disease. Osteone- crosis of the jaw in cancer patients for whom bisphospho- nate medications have been prescribed has been recognized since 2003 (BRONJ; see Chapter 13). At this time, clini- cians considered osteonecrosis of the jaws in patients receiv- ing bisphosphonate medications a distinct entity, possibly failing to recognize the historical presence of osteonecrosis of the jaws in patients with osteomyelitis exhibiting seques- tra, diabetes, and immune compromise (acquired immuno- deficiency syndrome [AIDS]), and in those patients who had undergone systemic chemotherapy for a variety of malignant diagnoses, with or without metastatic disease. Whereas osteonecrosis of the jaws in a cancer patient might be attributed to bisphosphonate use, there are some in- stances in which metastatic disease itself may be the cause of the osteonecrosis. Thus, surgical resection of the dead bone not only treats the condition but also permits histo- pathologic evaluation for the presence or absence of tumor.
Treatment and Prognosis
Metastatic carcinoma of the jaw requires further workup to identify the primary site and to stage the degree of meta- static involvement. This is useful in identifying whether the jaw metastasis represents a solitary focus or, as is often the case, is merely the clinical sign of disseminated skeletal disease. A single focus may be treated by surgical excision or chemoradiotherapy. Generalized skeletal metastases are usually an ominous event and are treated palliatively. The prognosis for patients with metastatic carcinoma of the jaws is grave, with a dismal 10% 5-year survival rate, and more than two thirds of patients dying within a year.

 Metabolic Conditions
Paget’s Disease
Paget’s disease, or osteitis deformans, is a chronic, slowly progressive metabolic disorder of bone of undetermined cause (Box 15-1). Etiologic theories include infection by paramyxovirus, environmental influences, and mutations in several genes that are involved in osteoclastogenesis with associated high levels of penetrance. Altered osteoclast development and function result in abnormal bone remod- eling. Osteoblast function is also abnormal in Paget’s disease, reflecting the overall alterations of all phases of bone physiology in this condition, which generally progresses through several stages that include an initial re- sorptive phase, followed by a vascular phase, and eventually by a sclerosing or osteoblastic phase where there may be up to a sevenfold increase in bone deposition. The formed sclerotic bone, although dense, is of poor quality with often- associated deformity and increased fracture risk.
In familial studies, clustering of Paget disease has been extensively documented, with specific mutations in the SQSTM1 gene identified in half of cases, while in non- familial cases, a small percentage of patients have been shown to carry these mutations.
Clinical Features
Paget’s disease is a hyperactive bone turnover state that typically occurs in patients older than 50 years. It is rela- tively common and has been reported to occur in 3% to 4% of the middle-aged population and in as many as

10% to 15% of the elderly, although the overall severity and disease prevalence over the past 30 years has shifted to a pattern of lesser severity and level of involvement. In approximately 14% of cases, a positive family history can be elicited. Paget’s disease has a 3:2 male predilection, and it seems to occur more often in patients of Northern European descent.
The most common sites of involvement include the pelvis, skull, tibia, vertebrae, humerus, and sternum. The jaws are affected in approximately 20% of patients, and the maxilla is involved twice as often as the mandible (Figure 15-1). At initial presentation, symptoms often relate to deformity or pain in the affected bone(s). Bone pain is described as deep and aching. A perception of elevated skin temperature over the affected bone is often noted because of the hypervascularity of the underlying bone. Neurologic complaints, including headache, audi- tory or visual disturbances, facial paralysis, vertigo, and weakness, may be related, in large part, to narrowing of the skull foramina, resulting in compression of vascular and neural elements. Approximately 10% to 20% of patients are asymptomatic and are incidentally diagnosed after radiographic or laboratory studies are performed for unrelated problems.
Classically, dental patients who wear complete den- tures may complain of newly acquired poor prosthetic adaptation and function as the maxilla symmetrically enlarges. The alveolar ridge ultimately widens, with relative flattening of the palatal vault. When teeth are present, increased spacing, as well as loosening, is noted. In severe cases, continued enlargement of the maxilla or mandible can make closure of the lips diffi- cult or impossible.
Classic radiographic findings in the late stage of Paget’s disease are due to bony sclerosis providing a patchy radi- opaque pattern described as resembling cotton or wool. In the jaws, this pattern of bone change may be associated with
hypercementosis or resorption of tooth roots, loss of lamina dura, and obliteration of the periodontal ligament space (Figures 15-2 and 15-3).
Histopathology
In the initial resorptive phase, random overactive osteoclas- tic bone resorption is evident. Resorbed bone is replaced by vascularized connective tissue in company with prominent osteolysis and osteogenesis. Bone eventually develops a dense mosaic pattern as a result of reversal lines in increas- ingly sclerotic bone, as osteoclasts give way to osteoblasts (Figures 15-4 and 15-5).
The laboratory can provide important information about the diagnosis of Paget’s disease. Serum calcium and serum phosphate levels are normal in the presence of markedly elevated total alkaline phosphatase levels. The intense osteoblastic activity in this metabolically active bone is believed to be responsible for the elevated alka- line phosphatase levels. The amount of bone resorption may be correlated with increases in urinary calcium and hydroxyproline levels.

• Figure 15-5 Paget’s disease showing a mosaic bone pattern with reversal lines and prominent capillaries.
Treatment
The primary indicator for therapeutic intervention is pa- tient discomfort. Elevation of total alkaline phosphatase levels to twice normal levels is also an indication for treat- ment. Therapy has been directed at controlling osteoclast formation and function. The use of calcitonin and
bisphosphonates has been effective. Both suppress bone resorption and deposition, as reflected in a reduction in the biochemical indices, including alkaline phosphatase and urinary hydroxyproline levels. A 50% reduction in either index constitutes a good therapeutic response (see Chapter 13 for complications of bisphosphonate ther- apy). Asymptomatic patients with mild manifestations of Paget’s disease and who are at low risk for secondary com- plications generally require clinical monitoring only and alkaline phosphatase level measurement.
Paget’s disease is a slowly progressive disorder, but it is seldom fatal. Relief of symptoms, particularly bone pain, with oral or intravenous bisphosphonates is beneficial. Complications include skeletal deformity, weakened bones, neurologic deficits, and pathologic fracture. Heart failure may also be an important complication of Paget’s disease as a consequence of the hypervascular bone. In the early vascular phase, bleeding following any type of bone surgery (e.g., tooth extraction) can be problematic. In a small percentage of cases, malignant transformation into osteosarcoma may occur. Depending on the series reported, this has ranged from 1% to 15%.
Hyperparathyroidism
Hyperparathyroidism may be one of three types: primary, secondary, or hereditary (Box 15-2). Rarely, hyperparathy- roidism may be associated with a Noonan-type syndrome, a complex, autosomal-dominant inherited trait comprising short stature, unusual facies, mental retardation, and cardiac defects. Additionally, hereditary syndromes such as multiple endocrine neoplasia types 1 and 2A, and others, include primary hyperparathyroidism as a component.
Primary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by hyperse- cretion of parathyroid hormone from one or more hyperplas- tic parathyroid glands (3%), a parathyroid adenoma (90%), or less commonly, an adenocarcinoma (3%). Characteristic abnormal laboratory findings include elevated calcium levels (the majority of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism cases are initially detected in this manner) and elevated and alkaline phosphatase levels resulting from parathormone stimulation of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, from decreasing calcium excretion in the kidneys, and from increased intestinal resorption.
Primary hyperparathyroidism: parathyroid adenoma, hyperplasia, and adenocarcinoma
Secondary hyperparathyroidism: compensatory hyperplasia for low serum calcium levels caused by renal failure, malabsorp- tion, or vitamin D deficiency
Elevated serum parathormone (PTH), calcium, alkaline phospha- tase levels, and decreased phosphate levels
Kidney stones, metastatic calcification, osteoporosis, fibroblastic/ giant cell tumors of bone, neurologic alterations, arrhythmias, and polyuria
   • BOX 15-2
Hyperparathyroidism
   
www.konkur.in
Secondary hyperparathyroidism occurs as a compensa- tory response to hypocalcemia, as may be found in renal failure and in patients undergoing renal dialysis (renal osteodystrophy), as well as in those with intestinal malab- sorption syndromes. In these patients, vitamin D3, which is activated in the kidney, is reduced. Vitamin D3 is required for calcium absorption and metabolism. The hereditary form has been shown to be an autosomal-dominant condition mapped to chromosome 1q21-q31, the location of the HRPT2 endocrine tumor gene.
Clinical Features
The disease spectrum of primary hyperparathyroidism ranges from asymptomatic cases (diagnosed by routine serum calcium determinations) to severe cases manifesting as lethargy and occasionally coma. The incidence increases with age (usually those older than age 60) and is greater in postmenopausal women. Early symptoms include fatigue, weakness, nausea, anorexia, arrhythmias, polyuria, thirst, depression, and constipation. Bone pain and headaches are often reported.
Several clinical features are associated with primary form of this disease, classically described as “stones, bones, groans, and moans,” reflective of renal calculi, bone pathol- ogy, duodenal ulcers, and confusion or dementia-like symp- toms, respectively. The renal component of stones or calculi or, more rarely, nephrocalcinosis is related to hypercalcemia, the metabolic marker of excess parathormone activity.
Gastrointestinal manifestations include peptic ulcer resulting from the increase in gastric acid, pepsin, and se- rum gastrin levels. Rarely, pancreatitis may develop as a result of obstruction of the smaller pancreatic ducts by calcium deposits.
Neurologic manifestations may become evident when se- rum calcium levels are very high, exceeding 16 to 17 mg/dL. In such instances, coma or parathyroid crisis may occur. Loss of memory and depression are common, and rarely, true psychosis may appear. Some of the neurologic findings may be attributed to calcium deposits in the brain.
Severe osseous changes (called in the past, osteitis fibrosa cystica) are the result of significant bone demineralization, with fibrous replacement producing radiographic changes that appear cystlike. In the jaws, these lesions microscopi- cally resemble central giant cell granuloma, or so-called “brown tumor,” reflective of the brownish hue derived from accumulated intralesional hemosiderin pigment and erythrocyte extravasation. Less obvious radiographic changes may include an osteoporotic appearance of the mandible and maxilla, reflecting more generalized resorp- tion (Figure 15-6). Loosening of the teeth may occur, as well as corresponding obfuscation of trabecular detail and overall cortical thinning. Partial loss of the lamina dura radiographically is seen in a minority of patients with hyperparathyroidism (Figures 15-7 and 15-8). Pulpal oblit- eration, with complete calcification of the pulp chamber and canals, has been reported in association with secondary hyperparathyroidism.
• Figure 15-6 Hyperparathyroidism producing numerous mandibu- lar radiolucencies.
• Figure 15-7 Hyperparathyroidism resulting in loss of lamina dura.
Histopathology
The bone lesions of hyperparathyroidism, although not specific, are important in establishing the diagnosis. The bony trabeculae exhibit osteoclastic resorption, as well as the formation of osteoid trabeculae by large numbers of osteoblasts. In these areas, a delicate fibrocellular stroma contains numerous multinucleated osteoclast type giant cells. Accumulations of hemosiderin and extravasated red blood cells are noted giving the tissues a reddish brown appearance, accounting for the term brown tumor. The lesions are microscopically identical to central giant cell granulomas.
Treatment
Management of primary hyperparathyroidism is aimed at eliminating the parathyroid pathology and monitoring the fall in C-terminal parathyroid hormone concentration. Sur- gery in the form of selective parathyroid removal is the treatment of choice in most instances because it offers the best opportunity for successful long-term results. Medi- cal management (bisphosphonates) may be used in some instances. Treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism caused by increased parathyroid function resulting from chronic renal failure is aimed at management of kidney disease and control or suppression of parathyroid hormone

suppression with vitamin D analogs and/or calcimimetics (e.g., cinacalcet). Dental and oral considerations in this form of hyperparathyroidism are similar to those in the primary form of the disease.
Hyperthyroidism
Hyperfunction of the thyroid gland, or hyperthyroidism, encompasses several conditions. It is characterized by exces- sive amounts of the thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) or by increased levels of thyroid- stimulating hormone (TSH) and associated hypermetabo- lism. In adults, hyperthyroidism occurs with an incidence of 3 cases per 10,000 per year, with a distinct female pre- ponderance of approximately 5:1.
The most common disorder leading to clinical hyperthy- roidism is Graves’ disease, which accounts for 70% to 85% of all cases. The cause is believed to be autoimmune in na- ture. It appears to be related to the production of abnormal thyroid stimulator (long-acting thyroid stimulator [LATS]), which differs chemically and functionally from TSH. LATS is able to bind the thyroid-TSH receptors in preference to TSH and to remain bound for prolonged periods. The LATS substance is immunoglobulin (Ig)G produced by B cells, which is capable of inducing thyroid hyperplasia and increasing iodine uptake by the thyroid, free of any central or pituitary gland influence. Thyrotoxicosis may also result from excess stimulation of the thyroid gland via the hypo- thalamic-pituitary axis, or by secretion of thyroid hormone from ectopic, endogenous, or exogenous sources. Thyroid neoplasia associated with increased levels of thyroid hor- mone also may be associated with clinical hyperthyroidism.
Heat intolerance, hyperhidrosis, and palmar erythema are common findings. Fine motor tremor and muscle weakness, palpitations, atrial fibrillation, diarrhea, anxiety and irritabil- ity, weight loss, and menstrual dysfunction are also commonly encountered. Patients may complain of an altered complexion and thinning, brittle hair. Ocular changes include upper lid retraction and so-called lid lag on normal blinking. The bright-eyed stare that often results from upper lid retraction
may be further accentuated by exophthalmos. Pretibial myx- edema and acropachy or soft tissue enlargement, finger club- bing, and a subperiosteal reaction of the metacarpals and phalanges may be found in patients with Graves’ disease.
Cardiac manifestations are among the earliest and most consistent features of this disease. Increased metabolic activity places greater demand on the cardio- vascular system; accordingly, increases in stroke volume/cardiac output, pulse rate, and cardiac output are usually observed.
Although the oral manifestations of this condition are not specific, they are consistent (Box 15-3). In children, premature or accelerated exfoliation of deciduous teeth and the concomitant rapid eruption of permanent teeth are of- ten noted. In adults, osteoporosis of the mandible and maxilla may be found. On occasion, patients may complain of a burning tongue, as well as other nonspecific symptoms. Of interest is a reported threefold increase in the incidence of dental erosion in these patients in comparison with euthyroid control subjects.
Medical treatment consists of symptom control with beta-blocker medication and reduction of thyroid hormone synthesis using thyroid-suppressive drug therapy or radioac- tive iodine administration, which essentially inactivates the hyperfunctional thyroid tissue. Thyroid-suppressive drugs include thiocarbamides such as propylthiouracil and

methimazole. These drugs inhibit iodine oxidation and io- dination of tyrosyl residues, two steps in the synthesis of thyroid hormones. Surgical treatment remains an option, although the potential for inadvertent parathyroid gland removal and subsequent hypoparathyroidism is a risk.
Of clinical importance is the need to reduce stress to minimize the risk of precipitating a thyroid crisis in patients with poorly controlled disease. The use of certain drugs such as epinephrine and atropine is contraindi- cated, because they may precipitate a thyroid storm, which is a life-threatening state of thyroid hormone- induced hypermetabolism.
Hypothyroidism
Hypothyroidism is a systemic condition that is caused by reduced production of thyroid hormone. This results from a number of factors including congenital defect, iodine deficiency goiter, autoimmune (Hashimoto’s) thyroiditis, diseases of the pituitary and hypothalamus (central hypo- thyroidism), and idiopathic disorders. The common result of these etiologic factors is cretinism when the condition occurs in children and myxedema when it occurs in adults.
The key clinical features are listed in Box 15-4. Diagno- sis is based on the history, the physical examination, deter- mination of serum levels of TSH, and tetraiodothyronine (T4). In typical hypothyroid patients with primary disease, T4 levels are low (sometimes normal) and TSH levels are high (compensatory pituitary reaction). In secondary dis- ease in which the pituitary gland is malfunctioning, both T4 and TSH levels are low. Of note, the clearance rate of several drugs may be decreased including opiates, hypnot- ics, and anticoagulants. Treatment is based on gradual re- placement with synthetic and natural thyroid hormone preparations.
Hypophosphatasia
Hypophosphatasia represents a deficiency of alkaline phos- phatase. This rare hereditary disorder is transmitted in an autosomal-recessive manner and is characterized by loss-of- function mutations in the genetic control of the tissue nonspecific isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase. Of dental significance is that this unusual genetic metabolic disease is

Edema of face, eyes, lips, and tongue Mental lethargy

one of the main causes of premature loss of the primary dentition. (Other conditions in which premature tooth ex- foliation may be seen include cyclic neutropenia, idiopathic histiocytosis, juvenile periodontitis, acrodynia, rickets, and Papillon-Lefèvre syndrome.) Although the primary denti- tion is nearly exclusively involved, adolescent and adult patients with this condition may also experience dental ab- normalities, including reduced marginal alveolar bone, ab- normal root cementum, focal areas of dentin resorption, altered mineralization of coronal dentin, and large coronal pulp chambers of the molar dentition.
Other dental and oral clinical features of hypophospha- tasia include enlarged pulp chambers of the primary teeth, alveolar bone loss with a predisposition for the anterior por- tion of the mandible and maxilla, and hypoplasia or aplasia of cementum over the root surface. Root development may be deficient, especially toward the apex. The crowns of the involved teeth demonstrate rickets-type changes, which are characterized chiefly by hypoplastic enamel defects. Enamel hypoplasia, increased pulp spaces, and premature tooth ex- foliation are present in the permanent and primary denti- tions. Dental abnormalities are the result of inadequate formation of both dentin and cementum.
Long bones show inadequate levels of mineralization with abnormally wide osteoid seams. Disordered bone min- eralization can lead to rickets, osteomalacia, fractures, and other bony abnormalities. Serum chemistry studies indicate a reduction in alkaline phosphatase levels, with concomi- tant urinary findings of detectable phosphoethanolamine. Tissue levels of alkaline phosphatase likewise are decreased in this disorder.
Four clinical types of hypophosphatasia have been recognized:
1. A congenital type has a 75% rate of neonatal mortality. 2. An early infantile type appears within the first 6 months of life, with a mortality rate of 50%. Renal calcinosis, as well as risks of cranial synostosis, delayed motor develop- ment, and premature loss of teeth, may accompany this
disease.
3. A late infantile or childhood type begins between 6 and
24 months of age. Skeletal findings tend to be less pro- nounced, but abnormalities of long bone structures, including irregular ossifications at the metaphysis, may be observed, along with rickets-type changes at the cos- tochondral junctions. Of importance in this form of the disease is premature loss of the anterior primary teeth, often the first sign of the illness.
4. The adult type, although distinctly uncommon, is char- acterized by bone pain, pathologic fractures, and a child- hood history of rickets.
No successful treatment is known, apart from control-
ling the hypercalcemia that results from the hypophospha- tasia. Large doses of vitamin D occasionally have produced partial improvement, although hypercalcemia and soft tis- sue calcinosis may result from such an approach. Genetic counseling of the family, as well as early diagnosis, is of great value.

Infantile Cortical Hyperostosis
Infantile cortical hyperostosis, or Caffey’s disease, is a very rare, self-limited, short-lived proliferative bone disease of ge- netic origin which usually manifests in early infancy. It is characterized by cortical-subperiosteal thickening of various bones, most commonly the mandible (80% of cases), and less commonly the clavicles, long bones, maxilla, ribs, and scapu- lae. Pain, fever, and hyperirritability are seen and a diagnostic triad consisting of swelling, bone lesions, and irritability is typical. The average age of onset is approximately 9 weeks, though later age of onset may be seen. From 75% to 90% of cases demonstrate mandibular involvement, typically over the angle and ascending ramus symmetrically. Sporadic cases of infantile cortical hyperostosis almost always show man- dibular involvement, and familial cases demonstrate such involvement approximately 60% of the time.
In addition to the osseous changes, swelling of overlying soft tissues usually occurs. There are no gender, racial, or geographic predilections. Familial and sporadic forms of this condition exist, with the mandible most commonly affected in the sporadic form. In unrelated families, the disease has been mapped to the 17q21 locus, and is inher- ited as an autosomal dominant trait.
Radiographically, an expansile hyperostotic process is visible over the cortical surface, with rounding or blunting of the mandibular coronoid process. Initially, the hyperos- totic element is separated from the underlying bone by a thin radiolucent line.
Diagnosis may be facilitated by the use of technetium (99mTc) scans, which are often positive, before routine radio- graphic detection is begun. Laboratory findings that are helpful in establishing the diagnosis include an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, increased phosphatase levels, anemia, leukocytosis, and occasionally thrombocytopenia or thrombocytosis.
Infantile cortical hyperostosis is usually a self-limiting process, with treatment generally directed at supportive care. Systemic corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) have been used with some success. This disease has a tendency to follow an uneven, although predictable, course, with possible relapses and remissions. During such recurrences or relapses, NSAIDS have been recommended to control symptoms and halt progression of the disease, suggesting that prostaglandins may have a role in the origin. The resolution phase ranges from 6 weeks to 23 months, with an average duration of 9 months. Radiographic and histologic resolution may take up to several years, with a generally excellent prog- nosis, despite the possibility of recurrences and occasional residual effects, such as severe malocclusion and man- dibular asymmetry.
Phantom Bone Disease (Gorham‘s Disease)
Phantom bone disease, also known as massive osteolysis, Gorham’s disease, or vanishing bone disease, is an unusual process characterized by posttraumatic or spontaneous slow,
progressive, localized destruction of bone secondary to a non-neoplastic vascular-lymphatic proliferation. It is associ- ated with variable levels of pain, swelling, and osteolysis. Additionally, a potential role for platelet-derived growth factor Rb has been suggested. Fibrovascular tissue may completely replace the involved bone, but the mechanism of onset of the vascular proliferation and bone destruction is unknown. This is a rare entity of unknown cause, with fewer than 150 cases reported since its initial description in 1838. The process has been described in virtually every bone in the body, with 15 cases reported in the maxillofacial region but can affect nearly all bones.
No ethnic or gender predilection has been noted. There appears to be no genetic basis for transmission. Various studies, including metabolic, endocrine, and neurologic tests, have not been helpful in determining the cause of phantom bone disease, with workup for alterations or pathology within these systems being negative.
In most patients, the disease develops before the fourth decade of life, although it has been described in patients ranging from 18 months to 72 years of age. On- set of the disease is insidious; pain usually is not a feature unless concomitant pathologic fracture of the involved bone occurs. Progressive atrophy of the affected bone, resulting in significant deformity, constitutes a useful diagnostic sign of massive osteolysis. Although most cases involve a single bone, the disease may be polyos- totic, usually affecting contiguous bones. This disease is progressive but variable; over time, the bone may completely disappear, or it may spontaneously stabilize, though stabilization may not occur, with ultimate disap- pearance of the affected bone or bones. Significant regeneration has not been reported.
The earliest radiographic sign of the disease has been reported to be one or more intermedullary subcortical radiolucencies of variable size, usually with indistinct margins and thin radiopaque borders. In time, these foci enlarge and coalesce, eventually involving the cortex. A characteristic tapering ultimately occurs when long bones are affected.
Laboratory studies fail to show biochemical abnor- malities. Microscopically, replacement of bone by con- nective tissue with many dilated capillaries and anasto- mosing vascular channels is noted. As the disease progresses, dissolution of both medullary and cortical bone is seen. A fibrotic band, thought to represent re- sidual periosteum, persists.
No standardized effective treatment for phantom bone disease is known, and surgical attempts at manage- ment have not been lasting, including bone graft place- ment, which itself may become affected. Moderate doses of radiation therapy (30-50 Gy) have had some measure of success. More recently medical treatments have in- cluded the use of bisphosphonates, antiangiogenic agents (interferon-a2b, thalidomide, bevacizumab, multitar- geted tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and other agents) with variable levels of success.

Acromegaly
Acromegaly is a rare condition with a prevalence of approximately 50 to 70 cases per million population and an incidence of 3 cases per million per year. This disease is characterized by bony and soft tissue overgrowth and meta- bolic disturbances. These changes occur as a result of chronic hypersecretion of growth hormone subsequent to closure of the epiphyseal plates. If hypersecretion occurs before epiphyseal closure, gigantism results.
Etiology
The cause in more than 90% of cases is hypersecretion of growth hormone from a benign pituitary adenoma, subse- quent to epiphyseal closure. The pituitary tumor may oc- casionally produce prolactin along with growth hormone (somatomedin C) or other hormones, including TSH or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Such adenomas are most common in the pituitary gland itself and may also develop in ectopic locations along the migration path of tissue from Rathke’s pouch. In general, growth hormone levels correlate proportionately with the size of the ade- noma, as well as with the overall severity of the disease. Growth hormone hypersecretion may also be related to fa- milial syndromic conditions including multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, McCune-Albright syndrome, and others.
Clinical Features
Acromegaly presents most often in the fourth decade, with an even gender distribution and no racial or geographic
predominance. This disorder is of insidious onset, and diag- nosis is often delayed for many years. Younger patients have more aggressive tumors and develop clinically recognizable acromegaly more rapidly.
Clinical signs and symptoms result from local effects of the expanding pituitary mass and the effects of excess growth hormone secretion (Figure 15-9). Affected individu- als present with hyperhidrosis, coarse body hair, muscle weakness, paresthesia/carpal tunnel syndrome, large joint arthropathy, dysmenorrhea, and decreased libido or impo- tence. Sleep apnea, hypertension, thickened skin over the face, hands, feet, and heart disease are also encountered. Skin tag formation is common and may be a marker for colonic polyps. In the facial bones and the jawbones, new periosteal bone formation may be seen, as well as cartilagi- nous hyperplasia and ossification. Resultant orofacial changes include frontal bossing, nasal bone hypertrophy, and relative mandibular prognathism or prominence. En- largement of the paranasal sinuses, as well as secondary la- ryngeal hypertrophy, produces a rather deep, resonant voice, which is typical of acromegaly. Overall coarsening of the facial features is noted, resulting from connective tissue hyperplasia and accumulation of glycoaminoglycans.
Oral manifestations include enlargement of the mandible and maxilla, with secondary separation of teeth resulting from alveolar overgrowth. Condylar hyperplasia with con- comitant bone formation at the anterior portion of the man- dible and a distinct increase in the gonial angle produces a rather typical dental malocclusion and prognathism.

complete posterior cross-bite is a common finding in such a circumstance. Thickened oral mucosa, increased salivary gland tissue, macroglossia, prominent lips, and prominent nasal profile are also noted in most instances. It has been re- ported that with concomitant changes in mandibular struc- ture, marked alterations in the diameter of the inferior alveo- lar canal, myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome, and speech abnormalities may result. Obstructive sleep apnea may de- velop secondary to upper airway obstruction as a result of macroglossia, mandibular prognathism, and hypertrophy of laryngeal mucosa and cartilage. The demonstration of growth hormone levels that are nonsuppressible by glucose loading is diagnostic. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the sella turcica may help confirm the diagnosis of acromegaly-associated tumor. Radioimmunoassay studies of somatomedin C may be used as a routine screening test.
Treatment
Treatment is related to normalization of growth hormone levels, with concomitant preservation of normal pituitary function. Traditionally, transsphenoidal surgery allowing access to the pituitary gland has been the therapeutic main- stay for acromegaly, with reduction of growth hormone levels ranging from 75% in cases of microadenomas to 50% for macroadenomas. Conventional radiotherapy and radiosur- gery are alternatives. Primary medical management using somatostatin receptor ligands such as octreotide are effective, as are growth hormone receptor antagonists and dopamine agonists. Radiotherapy is usually employed in cases of recur- rent or persistent tumors or those that are resistant or intoler- ant to usual medical management strategies.
Successful management may be reflected in reversal of soft tissue abnormalities, although many of the facial defor- mities may persist. In such instances, corrective oral and maxillofacial surgery may be indicated, including mandibu- lar osteotomy and partial glossectomy.
Genetic Abnormalities
Cherubism
Cherubism is a benign hereditary condition that affects the jaws only and is transmitted as an autosomal-dominant trait. Penetrance is 100% in males and 50% to 75% in females, with a 2:1 male predominance. Sporadic cases have also been seen. Cherubism has been classified by some investigators as an au- toinflammatory disease (i.e., a genetically determined chronic noninfectious inflammatory disorder). Infrequently, nonfamil- ial cases of cherubism have been reported, where new muta- tions in the gene have occurred.
Clinical Features
Cherubism affects the maxilla and/or mandible as a be- nign self-limiting fibro-osseous disorder that usually is found in children by 5 years of age (Box 15-5). The term cherubism has been used to describe patients with a bilat- erally symmetric swelling of the lower third of the face, marked fullness of the jaws, cheeks, and upwardly gazing

eyes, lending a “cherubic” appearance to the affected child. The mandibular angle, ascending ramus, retromolar region, and posterior maxilla are most often affected. The coronoid process can also be involved, but the condyles are always spared. A vast majority of cases occur only in the mandible. The bony expansion is most often bilateral, although unilateral involvement has been reported. The specific gene maps to chromosome 4p16.3, which encodes the SH3-binding protein, SH3BP2.
Patients typically have painless symmetric enlargement of the posterior region of the mandible, with expansion of the alveolar process and ascending ramus. The clinical appear- ance may vary from barely discernible posterior swelling of a single jaw to marked anterior and posterior expansion of both jaws, resulting in masticatory, speech, and swallowing difficulties (Figures 15-10 and 15-11). Intraorally, a hard, nontender swelling can be palpated in the affected area.
With maxillary disease, involvement of the orbital floor and the anterior wall of the antrum occurs. Superiorly di- rected pressure on the orbit results in increasing

prominence of the sclera and the appearance of upturned eyes. The palatal vault may be reduced or obliterated. Max- illary involvement usually results in the greatest deformity. All four quadrants of the jaws may be simultaneously in- volved with this painless process of bony expansion (Figure 15-12). Premature exfoliation of the primary denti- tion may occur as early as 3 years of age. Displacement of developing tooth follicles results in poor development of selective permanent teeth and ectopic eruption or impac- tion. Permanent teeth may be missing or malformed, with the mandibular second and third molars most often af- fected. Missing teeth in the adult range from 2 to 28, with a mean of 13 absent teeth. Significant malocclusions can be anticipated even with unifocal involvement.
Submandibular and upper cervical lymphadenopathy are common, although reactive regional lymphadenopathy, particularly of submandibular lymph nodes, usually sub- sides after 5 years of age. Intelligence is unaffected. Serum calcium and phosphorous levels are within normal limits, but alkaline phosphatase levels may be elevated.
Radiographic surveys may provide the only signs of dis- ease, which usually are evident by 3 years of age. Radio- graphic lesions are characterized by numerous well-defined multilocular radiolucencies of the jaws. The borders are distinct and are divided by bony trabeculae or septae. Seen in the mandible are expansion and thinning of the cortical plate with occasional perforation; displacement of the

inferior alveolar canal may be noted. An occlusal radiograph of the maxilla may give a soap bubble-like picture, with maxillary antrum obliteration. Unerupted teeth are often displaced and appear to be floating in the cystlike spaces.
Histopathology
Histologically, the lesions are composed of a vascularized fibrous stroma containing multinucleated giant cells, resembling central giant cell granuloma (Figure 15-13). Mature lesions exhibit a large amount of fibrous tissue and fewer giant cells. A distinctive feature that is often present is eosinophilic perivascular cuffing of collagen surrounding small capillaries throughout the lesion.

The clinical and histologic features may be mimicked by ossifying fibroma, giant cell granuloma, giant cell tumor, fibrous dysplasia, and Paget’s disease of bone.
Treatment and Prognosis
The prognosis is relatively good, particularly if the disease is limited to one jaw, especially the mandible. After a rapid pace of bone expansion, the disease is usually self-limiting and regressive. Radiographic evidence of the condition tends to persist. Although it is generally accepted that spon- taneous regression begins at puberty, with relatively good resolution by age 30, no long-term follow-up of spontane- ous resolution has been documented. Surgical intervention must be based on the need to improve function, prevent debility, and satisfy esthetic considerations. If necessary, conservative curettage of the lesion with bone recontouring may be performed.
Osteopetrosis
Osteopetrosis, also known as Albers-Schönberg disease, is a rare hereditary bone condition clinically characterized by a generalized symmetric increase in skeletal density due to de- fective bone resorption. Mutations in genes associated with osteoclastogenesis have been identified in patients with this disease. It can be divided into three clinical groups: (1) the infantile-malignant form is autosomal recessive in nature and is fatal within the first 2 to 3 years of life in the absence of treatment; (2) an intermediate autosomal-recessive type is nonfatal but clinically aggressive, with onset usually within the first decade; and (3) an autosomal-dominant form is the least severe, with full life expectancy but with considerable morbidity resulting from orthopedic alterations.
The characteristic feature of osteopetrosis is absence of physiologic bone resorption caused by reduced osteoclas- tic activity in spite of increased numbers of osteoclasts. Lack of bone resorption secondary to lack of acid secre- tion by osteoclasts and remodeling results in accumulation
of bone mass and manifests in skeletal disturbances, in- cluding sclerosis of bone marrow, decreased hematopoietic activity, and growth retardation. In mice with phenotypic features of osteopetrosis, the genetic abnormality resides in the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). This abnormality has not been identified in humans.
Clinical Features
Bone pain is the most common symptom. Cranial nerve compression may result in blindness, deafness, anosmia, ageusia, and occasionally facial paralysis. Normal cortical and cancellous bone is replaced by a dense, poorly structured bone that is fragile and has a propensity for pathologic fracture.
Delayed dental eruption is due to bony ankylosis, absence of alveolar bone resorption, and the formation of pseudo-odontomas during apicogenesis. Premature exfoliation may be due to a defect in the periodontal ligament.
The clinically benign adult form of osteopetrosis may not be diagnosed until the third or fourth decade. Optic and facial nerve impairment is often present as a result of narrowing of the cranial foramina and resultant pressure on the nerves. The first sign of the disease often is patho- logic fracture.
Dental findings include delayed eruption, congenitally absent teeth, unerupted and malformed teeth, and enamel hypoplasia (Figure 15-14). Decreased alveolar bone produc- tion, a defective and abnormally thickened periodontal liga- ment, and marked mandibular prognathism have been reported. An elevated caries index may be a result of enamel hypoplasia. This has serious implications because of the propensity for development of osteomyelitis resulting from inadequate host response caused by the diminished vascular component of osteopetrotic bone. Osteomyelitis is a serious complication of the disease; it occurs most often in the

mandible and occasionally in the maxilla, scapula, and extremities (Figure 15-15).
Radiographic findings are characteristic of this disease (Figure 15-16). The classic bone-within-bone radio- graphic presentation is due to a defect in metaphyseal bone remodeling, resulting in greatly thickened cortices and medullary space obliteration. Skeletal density gener- ally is greatly increased because of uniform diffuse scle- rosing of all bones. The mandible is less often involved than other bones. Loss of the distinct interface between cortical and medullary bone appears, along with clubbing of the long bones with transverse peripheral banding.
• Figure 15-15 Osteopetrosis showing generalized opacification of the jaws and skull.
• Figure 15-16 Osteopetrosis showing sclerotic change in the jaws and skull.
Histopathology
Osteopetrosis is histologically characterized by normal pro- duction of bone with absence of physiologic bone resorption. The pattern of endochondral bone formation is disrupted, with a decrease in osteoclastic function and a compensatory increase in the number of osteoclasts. This results in failure to develop normal lamellar structure in the bone and absence of definable marrow cavities. Biopsy specimens of endochondral bone exhibit a core of calcified cartilage surrounded by bone matrix.
Treatment and Prognosis
The prognosis for infantile osteopetrosis is poor, and patients rarely survive adolescence. Recent medical advances designed to increase osteoclast differentiation and activity may prove helpful. Such advances have included in utero stem cell treat- ment, receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB ligand (RANKL) replacement therapy, and denosumab administration. Bone marrow transplantation has been performed in severe child- hood or malignant forms of this disease in the past in an effort to provide monocyte, and possibly stem cell precursors, of osteoclasts.
Death results from secondary infection or anemia. The adult variety is more variable and insidious. Bone involve- ment is similar to that seen in the infantile recessive type but usually is less severe. The diagnosis often is not made until a pathologic fracture occurs. The differential diagnosis should include osteomalacia, Paget’s disease, hyperparathy- roidism, acromegaly, and malignant bone disease.
Osteogenesis Imperfecta
Osteogenesis imperfecta represents a genetically and pheno- typically heterogeneous group (nine major subtypes) of heritable defects of connective tissue with an estimated in- cidence of 1:20,000 births. Classically, this condition or syndrome may include fragile bones (“brittle bone dis- ease”), blue sclerae, ligament laxity, hearing loss, and den- tinogenesis imperfecta (Box 15-6). Some affected patients exhibit extreme bone fragility with numerous fractures and die during the perinatal period; those with mild forms of the disease suffer only premature osteoporosis, severe postmenopausal bone mineral loss and fragility but live a normal life span. Clinical presentation and severity are ex- tremely variable. Patients with osteogenesis imperfecta are

classified according to their clinical and radiographic mani- festations, as well as by inheritance pattern. Four distinct types have been identified: two inherited as autosomal- dominant traits, one inherited as an autosomal-recessive trait, and one inherited as both an autosomal-dominant and an autosomal-recessive trait. The presence of numerous long bone fractures early in life with dentinogenesis imper- fecta, blue sclerae, or both is sufficient to establish the diag- nosis. Early hearing loss in a patient or a member of the family with a history of fragile bones is highly suggestive of the disorder.
Biochemical findings suggest that osteogenesis imper- fecta syndromes are a result of inborn errors of collagen metabolism. Most forms of the disease are believed to be caused by mutations in the structural genes for collagen protein (COL 1A1 and COL 1A2). Autosomal forms of the disease are caused by mutations of genes encoding proteins involved with posttranslational modification of type 1 collagen and bone homeostasis.
Clinical Features
Osteogenesis imperfecta type I is characterized by osteopo- rosis, bone fragility, blue sclerae, and conductive hearing loss in adolescents and adults. Fractures may be present at birth in 10% of patients or may commence during infancy or childhood. Considerable variability is seen in age of on- set, frequency of fractures, and degree of skeletal deformity. Generally, birth weight and height are normal. Mild short stature is postnatal in onset and relates to the degree of in- volvement of the limbs and spine. Long bone deformities tend to be mild, with bowing of the limbs and angulation deformities occurring at previous fracture sites. Progressive kyphoscoliosis is seen in 20% of adults and may be severe. Hearing impairment, which usually begins in the second decade of life, is present in 35% of adults. Dentinogenesis imperfecta (see Chapter 16) is present in some patients with osteogenesis imperfecta type I.
Osteogenesis imperfecta type II is a lethal syndrome, and half of all patients are stillborn. It has an autosomal- recessive mode of transmission, although spontaneous cases have been reported. It is characterized in infancy by low birth weight, short stature, and broad thighs extending at right angles to the trunk. The limbs are short, curved, and grossly deformed. The skin is thin and frail and may be torn during delivery. Cranial vault ossification is lack- ing, and the facies is notable for hypotelorism, that is, a small beaked nose with a triangular shape. Defects in skel- etal ossification lead to extreme bone fragility and frequent fractures, even during delivery. Dental abnormalities have been found, including atubular dentin with a lacework of argyrophilic fiber structures, an absence of predentin, and an abundance of argyrophilic fibers in the coronal pulp.
Osteogenesis imperfecta type III is a rare disorder charac- terized in neonates by severe bone fragility, multiple frac- tures, and progressive skeletal deformity. Sclerae are blue at birth, but the color normalizes with age; adolescents and adults exhibit normal sclera coloration. Childhood mortality
is high because of cardiopulmonary complications, and the prognosis is poor because of severe kyphoscoliosis. Individu- als with type III disease exhibit the shortest stature of all patients with osteogenesis imperfecta. Dentinogenesis imperfecta is found in some patients with osteogenesis imperfecta type III.
Osteogenesis imperfecta type IV is a dominantly in- herited osteopenia leading to bone fragility, without the other classic features associated with osteogenesis imper- fecta syndromes. The sclerae are bluish at birth only. Onset of fractures ranges from birth to adulthood, and skeletal deformities are extremely variable. Bowing of the lower limbs at birth may be the only feature of this syn- drome, and progressive deformities of the long bones and the vertebral column may occur without fracture. Spontaneous improvement often occurs with puberty. Dentinogenesis imperfecta is seen in some patients with osteogenesis imperfecta type IV. The incidence of hear- ing impairment in adults is low.
Treatment and Prognosis
No specific treatment is available for this condition. How- ever, bisphosphonates have been used recently to improve bone density. The effect of the drug on fracture rate and bone growth is questionable. Management of fractures may be a significant orthopedic challenge. Rehabilitation and physical therapy for recurrent fractures, limb deformities, and kyphoscoliosis are suggested. Middle ear surgery may correct hearing loss. With the onset of puberty, the severity of this problem often lessens. When dentinogenesis imper- fecta is present, management is focused around preservation of the teeth. Generally, the primary dentition is more prob- lematic. To prevent wear and improve esthetic appearance, full crown coverage may be necessary.
Because of the wide variation in clinical expression, the prognosis ranges from very good (dominant form) to very poor (recessive form). Genetic counseling is essential, and patient support groups may provide needed emotional support to affected individuals and their families.
Cleidocranial Dysplasia
Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is notable for aplasia or hy- poplasia of the clavicles, characteristic craniofacial malfor- mations, and the presence of numerous supernumerary and unerupted teeth.
Etiology and Pathogenesis
Cleidocranial dysplasia is transmitted by an autosomal- dominant mode of inheritance with high penetrance and variable expressivity. A recessive form has been reported. Mutations in the transcription factor RUNX2, a regulator of bone differentiation, are the cause of this condition and are felt to be of the missense type. About one third of cases are sporadic and appear to represent new mutations. It oc- curs with equal frequency among males and females, and there is no racial predilection. Most patients with the disor- der are of normal intelligence.

Intramembranous and endochondral bones in the skull are affected, resulting in a sagittally diminished cranial base, transverse enlargement of the calvarium, and delayed closure of the fontanels and sutures. Hydrocephalic pres- sure on unossified regions of the skull, especially the fonta- nelles, causes biparietal and frontal bossing and extension of the cranial vault. The deficiency of the clavicles ranges from aplasia to hypoplasia and is responsible for the long appearance of the neck and the narrow shoulders. Com- bined abnormalities of the middle third of the face and the dental alveolar complex result in the characteristic facial appearance.
Delayed or failed eruption of the teeth has been associ- ated with lack of cellular cementum. It has been postulated that failure of cementum formation may be due to me- chanical resistance to eruption by dense alveolar bone over- lying the unerupted teeth. The formation of supernumerary teeth is due to incomplete or severely delayed resorption of the dental lamina, which is reactivated at the time of crown completion of the normal permanent dentition.
Clinical Features
The clinical appearance of CCD is so distinct that it is pathognomonic. The stature is mildly to moderately shortened, with the neck appearing long and narrow and the shoulders markedly drooped. Complete or partial absence of clavicular calcification, with associated muscle defects, results in hypermobility of the shoulders, allow- ing for variable levels of approximation in an anterior plane (Figures 15-17 and 15-18).
The head is large and brachycephalic with an overall bulky appearance of the forehead. Patients have pronounced frontal, parietal, and occipital bossing. The facial bones and paranasal sinuses are hypoplastic, giving the face a small and

short appearance with maxillary hypoplasia predominating. The nose is broad based, with a depressed nasal bridge. Ocular hypertelorism is often present. The entire skeleton may be affected, with defects of the pelvis, long bones, and fingers. Hemivertebrae and posterior wedging of the tho- racic vertebrae may contribute to the development of kyphoscoliosis and pulmonary complications.
Maxillary hypoplasia gives the mandible a relatively prognathic appearance, although some patients may show variable levels of mandibular prognathism caused by in- creased length of the mandible in conjunction with a short cranial base. The palate is narrow and highly arched, and the incidence of submucosal clefts and complete or partial clefts of the palate involving the hard and soft tissues is increased. Nonunion of the symphysis of the mandible is seen.
Formation, maturation, and eruption of the deciduous dentition are usually normal. Extreme delay in physiologic root resorption occurs, however, and the result is prolonged exfoliation of primary teeth. Eruption of the permanent dentition is severely delayed, and many teeth fail to erupt. Hypoplastic enamel, dentigerous cysts, and taurodontia are commonly noted. Unerupted supernumerary teeth are of- ten present in all regions (Figure 15-19) and are the major dental feature of CCD. They develop on completion of normal crown formation in the permanent dentition lin- gual and occlusal to the normal unerupted crown. Only one supernumerary tooth per normal tooth is generally noted. Overretention of deciduous teeth, failure of eruption of permanent teeth, numerous supernumerary teeth, and maxillary hypoplasia result in severe malocclusion.
Radiographic findings of clinical significance pertain to abnormalities of the craniofacial region, dentition, clavicles, and pelvis. Radiographs of the skull classically exhibit pat- ent fontanelles and wormian bones, broad and anomalous cranial sutures, and underdeveloped paranasal sinuses. The

clavicles may be aplastic unilaterally or bilaterally, or they may be hypoplastic, appearing as small fragments attached to the sternum or the acromial process. The mandible and the maxilla contain many unerupted and supernumerary teeth, which often are malpositioned.
Treatment
No specific treatment is available for patients with CCD. Genetic counseling is most important. Protective headgear may be recommended while fontanels remain patent. The current mode of therapy for the dental anomalies combines early surgical intervention with orthodontic therapy. Extrac- tion of supernumerary teeth and overretained primary teeth, when the root formation of succedaneous teeth is greater than 50%, is followed by surgical exposure of unerupted teeth and orthodontic treatment. Early surgical exposure of unerupted teeth has resulted in stimulation of cementum formation and eruption of the dentition with normal root formation. Orthognathic surgery for correction of the dental-facial deformity, postsurgical orthodontics, and the use of prosthetic rehabilitation can be anticipated.
Crouzon’s Syndrome (Craniofacial Dysostosis)
Crouzon’s syndrome is characterized by variable degrees of cranial deformity, maxillary hypoplasia, and shallow orbits with exophthalmos and divergent strabismus. The character of the cranial deformity depends on the sutures affected, the degree of involvement, and sequence alteration of sutural fu- sion. Increased interpupillary distance and exophthalmos are constant features of Crouzon’s syndrome and develop in early childhood as a result of premature synostosis of the coronal suture. Systemic complications include mental retardation, hearing loss, speech and visual impairment, and convulsions.
Etiology and Pathogenesis
Craniofacial dysostosis is inherited in an autosomal-domi- nant mode, with complete penetrance and variable
expressivity. About one third of reported cases arise sponta- neously. The genetic abnormalities associated with the larger family of craniosynostoses are thought to result from mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor family (FGFR1, -R2, -R3) genes as well as mutations of TWIST, MSX2 and ENFB1. More specifically, gain of function mutations of FGFR2 have been identified in this form of synostosis. The severity of expression of the disease increases in successive siblings, with the youngest child most severely affected.
Craniosynostosis results when premature fusion of the cranial sutures occurs. Premature closure of these sutures can initiate changes in the brain as a result of increased in- tracranial pressure, and deformities of the cranial bones and orbits. Underdevelopment of the supraorbital ridges and overgrowth of the sphenoid wing result in small and shal- low orbits; this further leads to exophthalmos and reduced orbital volume. Ocular hypertelorism is accentuated by downward and forward displacement of the ethmoid plate. Abnormalities of the bony orbit account for several func- tional ocular abnormalities. Severe distortion of the cranial base leads to reduced maxillary growth and nasopharyngeal hypoplasia with potential upper airway restriction.
Clinical Features
Patients with Crouzon’s syndrome have a characteristic fa- cies that often is described as froglike. Midface hypoplasia and exophthalmos are striking. Patients have relative man- dibular prognathism, with the nose resembling a parrot’s beak. The upper lip and the philtrum are usually short, and the lower lip often droops. The cranial deformity is depen- dent on which sutures are involved. Proptosis with strabis- mus and orbital hypertelorism is common. Optic nerve damage occurs in 80% of cases.
Oral findings include severe maxillary hypoplasia, result- ing in narrowing of the maxillary arch and a compressed, high-arched palate. Bilateral posterior lingual cross-bites are common. Premature posterior occlusion caused by the infe- riorly positioned maxilla results in an anterior open bite.
Radiographs of the skull reveal obliterated suture lines with obvious bony continuity. A hammered-silver appear- ance is often seen in regions of the skull where compensa- tory deformity cannot occur. Lordosis of the cranial base is apparent on lateral skull projections, and angular deformi- ties with vertical sloping of the anterior cranial fossa can be visualized. A large calvarium with hypoplasia of the maxilla, shallow orbits, and a relatively large mandible is common.
Treatment and Prognosis
Age at onset and the degree of craniosynostosis influence the severity of the complications, which range from cranio- facial dystrophy to hearing loss, speech and visual impair- ment, and mental retardation. With a high degree of suspi- cion, the condition is often identifiable at birth. Ultrasonic prenatal diagnosis of exophthalmos has been reported. Early recognition is essential to guide growth and develop- ment of the face and cranium. Surgical intervention may be
 
www.konkur.in
necessary if exophthalmos is progressive, optic nerve dam- age or visual acuity is impaired, evidence of developing mental deficiency is noted, or intracranial pressure contin- ues to rise. Treatment includes the surgical placement of artificial sutures to allow growth of the brain while mini- mizing intracranial pressure and secondary calvarial defor- mities. Orthodontic treatment with subsequent orthogna- thic surgical intervention has been successful in managing the concomitant dentofacial deformity.
Treacher Collins Syndrome (Mandibulofacial Dysostosis)
Treacher Collins syndrome primarily affects structures developing from the first branchial arch, but it also in- volves the second branchial arch to a minor degree. Indi- viduals have a convex facial profile with a prominent nose and a retrusive chin. It is generally a bilateral anomaly with a characteristic facies, including downward sloping of the palpebral fissures, colobomas of the lower eyelid, mandibular and midface hypoplasia, and deformed pinnas (Figure 15-20).
Etiology and Pathogenesis
Treacher Collins syndrome is transmitted by an autosomal- dominant mode of inheritance, although about half of cases are due to spontaneous mutation. Mutations are thought to occur in the TCOF1 gene that encodes a nuclear phospho- protein known as treacle, a serine and alanine-rich nucleolar component which functions during biogenesis of the ribo- some complex in cranially directed neural crest cells. The gene has a high degree of penetrance, but variable expressiv- ity is common. Affected siblings are remarkably similar, and the syndrome becomes progressively more severe in suc- ceeding generations. This disorder is relatively rare, with an incidence between 0.5 and 10.6 cases per 10,000 births.
It is believed that the embryologic and morphologic de- fects that result in phenotypic expression of this syndrome begin as early as the sixth to seventh embryonic week. A defect in the stapedial artery during embryogenesis may be responsible for the anatomic deficits seen. Stapedial
artery dysfunction gives rise to defects of the stapes and incus and the first arch vessels supplying the maxilla. Failure of the inferior alveolar artery to develop an ancillary vascu- lar supply gives rise to mandibular abnormalities. Improper orientation and hypoplasia of the mandibular elevator muscles, resulting from an aplastic or hypoplastic zygomatic arch, may be contributory.
Mandibular retrognathia and midface vertical excess may be accentuated by the pull of abnormally oriented mandibular elevator muscles, causing a backward rotation in the man- dibular growth pattern. The syndrome seems to be limited to defects of the bones and soft tissue of the face. Vascularization of the posterior portion of the second visceral arch by the stapedial artery seems unimpaired.
Clinical Findings
Treacher Collins syndrome is a manifestation of combined developmental anomalies of the second, and mainly, first branchial arches. It includes various degrees of hypoplasia of the mandible, maxilla, zygomatic process of the temporal bone, and external and middle ear. Abnormalities of the me- dial pterygoid plates and hypoplasia of the lateral pterygoid muscles are common. Right-to-left asymmetry of the defor- mities is generally seen. In the fully expressed syndrome, the facial appearance is characteristic and is often described as birdlike or fishlike.
Notched or linear colobomas of the outer third of the lower eyelids are found in 75% of patients. The lower eye- lashes are absent medial to the colobomas in about 50% of patients. Antimongoloid obliquity, or downward slanting of the palpebral fissures, is striking.
Congenital atresia of the external auditory canal and mi- crotia are often present. The ears are low set, with deformed, crumpled, or absent pinnae. Middle ear defects include fi- brous bands of the long process of the incus, malformed and fixed stapes and malleus, and accompanying conductive hear- ing loss. Ear tags and blind fistulas are often located between the pinna and the commissures of the mouth.
Atypical hair growth in the shape of a tonguelike pro- cess extends from the hairline toward the cheeks. Other

Metabolic and Genetic Diseases
associated anomalies such as skeletal deformities and facial clefts may be concomitant.
Oral findings include cleft palate in about 30% of pa- tients and macrostomia in 15% of patients. A high-arched palate and dental malocclusion consisting of apertognathia and widely separated and displaced teeth are common. Se- vere mandibular hypoplasia is most characteristic. The un- derdeveloped zygomaticomaxillary complex leads to a clini- cally severe midface deficiency.
Treacher Collins syndrome is notable for characteristic ra- diographic findings, including downward sloping floors of the orbits, a peaked bony nasal contour, an aplastic or hypoplastic zygomatic process of the temporal bone, and an obtuse man- dibular angle. Lateral cephalograms demonstrate antegonial notching and a broad curvature of the mandible. The peculiar broad and concave nature of the inferior border of the man- dible is characteristic and helps distinguish this condition from other syndromes involving the mandible. The condyle and coronoid processes are often flattened or aplastic.
Treatment and Prognosis
Treatment is directed at chronologic surgical correction or reconstruction of existing deformities. Neutralization of con- ductive hearing loss through surgery and hearing aids is help- ful. Ophthalmologic surgery is often performed to correct eye deformities through orbital reconstruction. Extensive orthodontic treatment can be anticipated before orthogna- thic surgical reconstruction of the mandible and maxilla.
Pierre Robin Syndrome (Pierre Robin Sequence)
The clinical presentation of micrognathia, glossoptosis, and high-arched or cleft palate in neonates has been termed Pierre Robin syndrome. This malformation complex can occur as an isolated finding or as a component of various syndromes or developmental anomalies. The mandibular retrognathia and hypoplasia is considered the primary mal- formation. Respiratory and feeding problems are prevalent and may result in episodic airway obstruction, infant hypoxia, malnutrition, and failure to thrive.
Etiology and Pathogenesis
The incidence of Pierre Robin syndrome is 5.3 to 22.7 per 100,000 births, and 39% of infants exhibit no additional abnormalities. Of the remaining infants, 25% have known syndromes, and 36% have one or more anomalies that are not part of a known syndrome. Candidate genes (GAD67, PVRL1, SOX9) for this syndrome have been proposed.
Fetal malposition and interposition of the tongue be- tween the palatal shelves have long been considered the etiologic catalysts for palatal deformity and micrognathia. Arrest of mandibular development may prevent descent of the tongue and failure of palatal shelf elevation and fusion. Evidence suggests that the primary defect may be due to genetically influenced metabolic growth disturbances of the maxilla and mandible, rather than to mechanical obstruc- tion by the tongue during embryogenesis. Organogenetic differences lead to the variable presentation of micrognathia and cleft palate.
Clinical Features
Infants present with severe micrognathia, glossoptosis, cleft palate, and mandibular hypoplasia with distal tongue prolapsed and consequent airway obstruction of variable proportion, to the point of life-threatening hypoxia. A U-shaped cleft palate is a common but not constant feature, and in some instances, the palate is highly arched. Glossop- tosis is the result of retropositional attachment of the genio- glossus muscle caused by the retrognathic mandible. The ge- niohyoid muscle is foreshortened, so that support to the hyoid bone and strap muscles of the larynx is compromised.
Treatment and Prognosis
Respiratory and feeding problems are common in the im- mediate postnatal and neonatal periods. Constant medical supervision may be necessary to prevent apnea and airway obstruction and hypoxia, cor pulmonale, gastroesopha- geal reflux, bronchopneumonia, and exhaustion. In most cases, conservative repositioning of the infant and frequent prone positioning are sufficient to prevent upper airway obstruction, by making optimal use of the effects of gravity during resting and feeding. Continuous pulse oximetry and apnea monitoring are prudent during the neonatal period. In severe cases with chronic upper airway obstruction and failure to thrive, one of several procedures might be neces- sary: intraoral or nasopharyngeal intubation, surgical adhe- sion of tongue and lip (glossopexy), mandibular distraction osteogenesis, and tracheostomy. Feeding infants with man- dibular hypoplasia requires expertise and patience. Nasogas- tric feeding tubes may be required. After the first few months of life, mandibular growth and improved control of tongue musculature result in significant abatement of symptoms.
Growth of the mandible is remarkable during the first 4 years of life, and a normal profile is often achieved between 4 and 6 years of age. Some patients have a residual mild mandibular retrognathia requiring treatment later in life.
Marfan’s Syndrome
Marfan’s syndrome is a heritable disorder of connective tis- sue that is characterized by abnormalities of the skeletal, cardiovascular, and ocular systems. It is currently estimated that 23,000 Americans have Marfan’s syndrome. Diagnosis is problematic because of the extreme variability of clinical expression. The disorder is notable for a number of sudden catastrophic deaths that have occurred in affected (undiag- nosed) athletes.
Etiology and Pathogenesis
Marfan’s syndrome is an inherited autosomal-dominant dis- order that affects 1 in 10,000 individuals. There are no eth- nic, racial, or gender predilections. The condition exhibits complete but extremely variable penetrance, with offspring of an affected individual having a 50% chance of acquiring the disorder. Approximately 15% to 35% of cases arise spontane- ously as a result of gamete gene mutation in the ovum or sperm; a greater number occur with increasing paternal age. Diagnosis is currently based on characteristic abnormalities of the musculoskeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular systems
 
www.konkur.in
with a positive family history. Because most features progress with age, the diagnosis is often more obvious in older per- sons. The gene for Marfan’s syndrome has been located on chromosome 15 and will provide for diagnostic testing in pairs at risk. Recent studies involving factors responsible for assisting in microfibril formation have identified the gene for fibrillin (FBN1) as the disease-causing gene in this disorder. The Marfan gene is believed to produce a change in one of the proteins that provides strength to a component of con- nective tissue, probably collagen.
Clinical Features
Patients characteristically possess a tall, slender stature with relatively long legs and arms, large hands with long fingers, and loose joints. The arms, legs, and digits are dispropor- tionately long compared with the patient’s trunk. Chest deformities include a protrusion or indentation of the breast bone (pectus carinatum or pectus excavatum, respec- tively). The normal thoracic kyphosis is often absent, lead- ing to a straight back. Various degrees of scoliosis are pres- ent. Oral findings include a narrow, high-arched palate and dental crowding. The face appears long and narrow.
The cardiovascular system is affected in nearly all per- sons. Mitral valve prolapse as a result of myxomatous change occurs in 75% to 85% of affected patients, and a small percentage develop mitral regurgitation. Cystic me- dionecrosis of the aorta occurs, resulting in ascending aortic dilation, aortic regurgitation, and heart failure. A significant consequence of this change to the medial layer of the aorta is progressive dissection, which may lead to aneurysms, placing patients at great risk for death.
Ocular findings include dislocation of the lens (ectopia lentis), which occurs in half of these patients. The most com- mon eye anomaly, however, is myopia (nearsightedness). Retinal detachment occurs infrequently, but it is more prevalent after lens removal.
Treatment and Prognosis
Morbidity and mortality are directly related to the degree of connective tissue abnormality in involved organ systems. Cardiovascular abnormalities of dilation of the ascending aorta and mitral valve prolapse, subluxation of the lens of the eye, chest cavity deformities and scoliosis, and the po- tential for pneumothorax are serious prognostic indicators.
Treatment of patients with Marfan syndrome consists of annual medical examination with a cardiovascular empha- sis, frequent ophthalmologic examination, scoliosis screen- ing, and echocardiography. Physical activity is often restricted and redirected in an attempt to protect the aorta.
Antibiotic prophylaxis has been recommended for infec- tive endocarditis, regardless of clinical evidence of valvular disease. Beta-blockers such as propranolol are often used to reduce aortic stress and have been shown to significantly re- duce both the rate of aortic dilation and the risk of serious complications. Mortality has been drastically reduced with the use of composite grafts to replace the aortic valve and the region containing the aortic aneurysm. The prognosis for untreated aneurysms of the ascending aorta is extremely poor.
CHAPTER 15 Metabolic and Genetic Diseases Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is an uncommon inherited disor- der of connective tissue that is clinically characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and fragility. Clinical manifestations of the disease are due to inherited defects in collagen metabolism. In addition to the skin and joint anomalies, severe cardiovascular and gastrointestinal complications may occur and coexist.
The condition has been classified into eight variants. The periodontal form (Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIII) is char- acterized by rapidly progressing periodontal disease, resulting in complete tooth loss by the second or third decade of life.
Etiology and Pathogenesis
Various subtypes of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are inherited as autosomal-dominant, autosomal-recessive, and X-linked traits. Clinical presentations of recessively inherited forms are more severe.
At least 10 subtypes of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome have been classified on the basis of genetic, biochemical, and clinical characteristics. For instance, in the potentially lethal type IV variant, mutations in the gene for type III procollagen have been identified. Mutations in the lysyl hydroxylase gene are associated with the type XI variant, whereas types VIIa and VIIb are related to type I collagen gene mutations.
From a clinical standpoint, defects in type III collagen forma- tion are associated with spontaneous rupture of the aorta or in- testines, tissues rich in type III collagen. Deficiencies in collagen hydroxylysine are the result of depressed levels of lysyl hydroxy- lase. Others may have a defect in collagen metabolism, prevent- ing the conversion of procollagen to collagen. Also, a disorder of copper metabolism has been noted in some patients.
Clinical Features
Classic clinical features include marked hyperelasticity of the skin and extreme laxity of the joints. The skin may be stretched for several centimeters, but when released, it resumes its former contours. Skin manifestations include a velvety appearance with a high degree of fragility and a tendency toward bruising. Minor trauma may produce ecchymoses, bleeding, and large, gaping wounds with poor healing tendencies and “cigarette paper” scar formation, which is especially evident on the forehead and lower legs and over pressure points. Other cutaneous findings include molluscoid pseudotumors, redundant skin on the palms and soles, and subcutaneous lipid-containing cysts, which may calcify.
Articular hypermobility is variable. It may be of suffi- cient severity to cause spontaneous dislocation of the joints. Extreme joint laxity leads to genu recurvatum (back knee), flat feet, habitual joint dislocation, kyphoscoliosis, and other skeletal deformities.
Patients may have severe cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and pulmonary manifestations. Cardiovascular anomalies include dissecting aortic aneurysm, mitral valve prolapse, and rupture of major blood vessels. Most patients have a bleeding diathesis that may consist of a tendency to bruise or that may be severe, with hematoma formation and bleed- ing from the nose, gut, lungs, and urogenital tract.

364 CHAPTER 15
Metabolic and Genetic Diseases
Rupture of the bowel and bladder may occur. Pulmonary problems include spontaneous pneumothorax and respiratory impairment resulting from chest wall deformities. Hernias, gas- trointestinal diverticula, and ocular defects may be encountered.
Orofacial features include a narrow maxilla, a flattened midface, and a wide nasal bridge. Other facial findings include hypertelorism, epicanthal folds, a hollowed ap- pearance of the eyes, and scarring of the forehead and chin. Fragility of gingival and mucosal tissues may be problematic. The incidence of temporomandibular joint dysfunction is increased as a result of profound laxity of the joint, contributing to hypermobility and dislocation. Marked extensibility of the tongue, enabling contact with the tip of the nose, has been described.
Dental findings include deep anatomic grooves and excessive cuspal height of the molars and premolars. Stunted or dilacer- ated roots and the presence of free-floating coronal pulp stones resulting from alteration and calcification of intrapulpal vascular structures have been noted. Irregular composition of dentinal tubules, denticles, and enamel hypoplasia are often seen.
Treatment and Prognosis
The prognosis is dependent on the severity of the systemic manifestations. The cardiovascular status of all patients should be evaluated and closely monitored. Sudden death in youth or early adult life may occur as the result of dissect- ing aneurysms and ruptured arteries.
Surgical intervention must be tempered in light of connective tissue fragility. Joint ligament repair is often unsuccessful because of suture failure. Wound healing usually is delayed, and pro- longed bleeding may occur after injury. Osteoarthritis is a com- mon complication in patients with repeated dislocations.
Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21)
Down syndrome is a common and easily recognizable chro- mosomal aberration. The incidence is reported to be 1 in 600 to 1 in 700 live births; however, more than half of af- fected fetuses spontaneously abort during early pregnancy. Approximately 10% to 15% of all institutionalized patients have Down syndrome.
Most cases of trisomy 21 (94%) are caused by nondis- junction, resulting in an extra chromosome. The remaining patients with Down syndrome have various chromosome abnormalities. The translocation type occurs in 3%, mosa- icism occurs in 2%, and rare chromosomal aberrations make up the remaining 1% of cases. The incidence of this condition rises with increasing maternal age.
Etiology and Pathogenesis
Possible origins of Down syndrome include undetected mosa- icism in a parent, repeated exposure to the same environmental insult, genetic predisposition to nondisjunction, an ovum with extra chromosome 21, and preferential survival in utero of tri- somy 21 embryos and fetuses with increasing maternal age. Parents of any age who have had one child with trisomy 21 have a significant risk (about 1%) of having a similarly affected child, a risk of recurrence equivalent to that affecting births to a mother older than 45 years. No racial, social, economic, or gender pre- dilections have been identified.
Clinical Features
Patients with Down syndrome present with numerous charac- teristic clinical findings and various common systemic mani- festations (Figure 15-21). A number of common phenotypic

findings in children with Down syndrome have been identi- fied; these can assist in establishing a diagnosis.
Various degrees of mental retardation occur in all patients with Down syndrome. Most mildly affected individuals are highly functioning and are able to perform well in a work- shop environment. Dementia affects about 30% of patients with Down syndrome, and early aging is common. After age 35, nearly all individuals develop the neuropathologic changes analogous to those found in Alzheimer’s disease, although 70% exhibit no clinically detectable behavioral changes. These two disorders have many neuropathologic and neurochemical similarities, and an increased risk for Down syndrome has been found in families with a predilec- tion for Alzheimer’s disease.
In Down syndrome, the skull is brachycephalic, with a flat occiput and a prominent forehead. A third or fourth fontanel is present, and all fontanels are large and have extended patency. Sagittal suture separation greater than 5 mm is present in 98% of affected individuals. Frontal and sphenoid sinuses are absent, and the maxillary sinus is hy- poplastic in more than 90% of patients. Midface skeletal deficiency is quite marked, with ocular hypotelorism, a flat- tened nasal bridge, and relative mandibular prognathism.
The eyes are almond shaped, with upward-slanting pal- pebral fissures, epicanthic folds, and Brushfield’s spots of the iris often noted. Other ocular anomalies include conver- gent strabismus, nystagmus, refractive errors, keratoconus, and congenital cataracts.
Congenital heart disease is present in 30% to 45% of all patients with Down syndrome. Anomalies include atrioven- tricular communication, partial endocardial cushion abnor- malities, and ventricular septal defects. One study revealed a 50% prevalence of mitral valve prolapse; one third of these patients had negative auscultatory findings. Tetralogy of Fallot, patent ductus arteriosus, and secundum atrial septal defects are seen less often.
It appears that T-cell and probably B-cell function is aber- rant, with some affected children being more susceptible to infectious disease. Respiratory tract infections are extremely common. Thyroid dysfunction occurs in upward of 50% of all patients. The incidence of acute lymphocytic leukemia and hepatitis B antigen carrier status are increased.
Skeletal problems include hypoplasia of the maxilla and sphenoid bones, rib and pelvic abnormalities, hip disloca- tion, and patellar subluxation. Of particular concern is the presence of atlantoaxial instability in 12% to 20% of per- sons with Down syndrome; this is caused by increased laxity of the transverse ligaments between the atlas and the odon- toid process. Delay in recognizing this condition may result in irreversible spinal cord damage, which might occur dur- ing manipulation of the neck in patients undergoing dental therapy or general anesthesia.
Oral manifestations of Down syndrome are common. The tongue is often fissured, and macroglossia is usually relative to the small oral cavity, although true macroglossia is possible. An open-mouth posture is common because a narrow nasopharynx and hypertrophied tonsils and
adenoids cause upper airway compromise. A protruding tongue and habitual mouth breathing result in drying and cracking of the lips. Palatal width and length are signifi- cantly decreased, and a bifid uvula and cleft lip and palate are occasionally observed. Elevated concentrations of so- dium, calcium, and bicarbonate ion have been demon- strated in parotid saliva.
The dentition exhibits a number of characteristic anom- alies, and periodontal disease is prevalent. The incidence of dental caries, however, appears to be no greater than in normal individuals. Given the existence of poor oral hy- giene, this may reflect the greater buffering capacity of the saliva or the ability to control dietary intake in institutional and home settings. A defective immune system and neutro- phil motility defects directly contribute to rampant and precocious periodontal disease.
Eruption of the primary and permanent dentitions is delayed in 75% of cases. Abnormalities in eruption sequence occur often. Hypodontia occurs in both denti- tions, and microdontia is often seen. Developmental tooth anomalies, including crown and root malformations, are often present. Almost 50% of patients with Down syndrome exhibit three or more dental anomalies. Enamel hypocalcification occurs in about 20% of patients.
Occlusal disharmonies consisting of malocclusion caused by relative prognathism, posterior cross-bites, apertognathia, and severe crowding of the anterior teeth are common. Posterior cross-bites are of maxillary basal bone origin, whereas anterior open bites are due to dental-alveo- lar discrepancies.
Treatment and Prognosis
Infants with Down syndrome that includes significant congenital heart disease have a poor prognosis. Causes of death commonly include cardiopulmonary complications, gastrointestinal malformations, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Recent technologic advances in cardiovascular diag- nosis have brought about marked improvement in the prognosis. Newborns require chest x-ray studies, elec- trocardiograms, echocardiograms, and subsequent pe- diatric cardiac consultation if cardiovascular anomalies are detected.
Regular ophthalmologic and audiologic follow-ups are extremely important. They can intercept early visual and hearing problems that may affect learning and develop- ment. Detection of atlantoaxial instability may prevent a catastrophic spinal injury.
Dental therapy is directed at prevention of dental caries and periodontal disease. Frequent follow-up and establishment of stringent home care regimens are critical. Highly functioning children may be candidates for orthodontic intervention and subsequent maxillofa- cial surgery, if required. Guidelines established by the American Heart Association for antibiotic prophylaxis should be followed for those patients with congenital heart disease.

Metabolic and Genetic Diseases
Hemifacial Atrophy
Hemifacial atrophy is a rare disorder that represents a pro- gressive unilateral atrophy of the face. It occasionally may affect other regions on the same side of the body. The cause of this condition is unknown, although trauma, dysfunction of the peripheral nervous system, infection, and genetic abnormalities have been suggested.
Hemifacial atrophy typically appears during young adulthood. The most common early sign is a painless cleft or furrow near the midline of the face. The condition in- volves both soft tissue and bone of the affected side. Orally, the tongue, lips, and salivary glands may show hemiatro- phy. Developing teeth may show incomplete root develop- ment and delayed eruption. Unilateral involvement of the brain, ears, larynx, esophagus, diaphragm, and kidneys has been reported. Various associated ophthalmologic condi- tions are often encountered.
Progressive hemifacial atrophy associated with contralat- eral jacksonian epilepsy, trigeminal neuralgia, and changes in the eyes and hair is known as Parry-Romberg syndrome. Unilateral atrophy of the upper lip with visible exposure of the maxillary teeth on the affected side is characteristic in moderately and severely involved cases.
The differential diagnosis should include facial hypopla- sia, scleroderma, fat necrosis, and oculoauriculovertebral- related disorders. The distinction between Parry-Romberg syndrome and localized scleroderma is often difficult and depends on the absence or presence of skin pigmentation and other inflammatory changes.
Hemifacial Hypertrophy
Congenital hemihypertrophy is a rare disorder character- ized by gross body asymmetry. It may be simple, limited to a single digit; segmental, involving a specific region of the body; or complex, encompassing half the body. The en- largement is usually unilateral, although limited bilateral crossover does occur. All tissues in the region of abnormal growth may be involved, but a selective number of tissues are occasionally affected. Histologically, it has been deter- mined that there is an actual increase in the number of cells present, rather than an increase in cell size. This condition classically presents as a unilateral, localized overgrowth of the facial soft tissues, bones, and teeth (Figure 15-22).
Etiology and Pathogenesis
Gross asymmetry has been found in 1 in 86,000 patients, with a 3:2 female preponderance. In males, involvement of the right side is more common. Almost all cases appear to be sporadic. Equal numbers of segmental and complex forms are known, with neither side of the body exhibiting a greater in- cidence of involvement. Wilms’ tumor is the most common neoplasm reported in association with hemihypertrophy.
Multiple causative factors have been implicated in the development of hemihypertrophy, including anatomic and functional vascular or lymphatic abnormalities, en- docrine dysfunction, an altered intrauterine environ- ment, central nervous system disturbances, chromosome
• Figure 15-22 Hemifacial hypertrophy as part of epidermal nevus syndrome.
abnormalities, and asymmetric cell division. Etiologic heterogeneity may be responsible for the varied clinical presentation, affecting single or multiple systems, and the degree of tissue involvement.
Clinical Features
The varieties and complexities of hemihypertrophy have re- sulted in a wide range of reported dentofacial findings. In some patients, the face is involved solely, but unilateral facial enlargement is often associated with hypertrophy of a por- tion of the body. The tissues involved often are not affected uniformly, accentuating the variable clinical presentation.
Craniofacial findings include asymmetry of the frontal bone, maxilla, palate, mandible, alveolar process, condyles, and associated overlying soft tissue. The skin may be thick- ened, with excessive secretions by sebaceous and sweat glands and hypertrichosis. The pinnae often are remarkably en- larged. Unilateral enlargement of one of the cerebral hemi- spheres may be responsible for mental retardation in 15% to 20% of patients, and for the occurrence of seizure disorders.
Oral findings are quite striking, affecting the dentition and the tongue to a significant degree. The tongue is unilat- erally hyperplastic and often is distorted in appearance, with a distinct midline demarcation. Fungiform papillae are usually enlarged and resemble soft polypoid excrescences. Dysgeusia has been reported. Intraoral soft tissues are thick- ened and anatomically enlarged, and are often described as overabundant and lying in soft, velvety folds.
Dental findings include abnormalities in crown size and root size and shape, as well as precocious development and eruption. Permanent canines, premolars, and first molars
   
www.konkur.in
are most often enlarged. When the primary dentition is affected, abnormalities are limited to the second molars and, less commonly, the canines. Unilateral macrodontia approaches but does not exceed a 50% increase in crown dimension in mesiodistal and buccolingual diameters. Root size and shape are proportionately enlarged or un- commonly shortened, and premature apical development is usual. The primary teeth on the affected side calcify, erupt, and exfoliate sooner than the contralateral teeth. Eruption of the affected permanent teeth by age 4 or 5 years has been reported.
Dental malocclusions are common because of asymmet- ric growth of the maxilla, mandible, and alveolar process and abnormalities of tooth morphology and eruption pat- terns. Midline deviations, severely canted occlusal planes, and open bites are common.
Lateral and posterior-anterior cephalograms demonstrate pronounced bony asymmetry and facial bone hypertrophy, as well as evidence of hypertrophied soft tissues, such as tonsillar enlargement. Root anomalies, crown enlargement, and evidence of premature eruption are easily identifiable by panoramic or periapical radiography.
Differential Diagnosis
The diagnosis of true congenital hemifacial hypertrophy rests on the presence of unilateral hypertrophy of the cra- niofacial structures and associated soft tissue, including the dentition. Perception of contralateral dissimilarity may be difficult and often is subjective, resulting in de- layed diagnosis of congenital hemifacial hypertrophy in the infant. Angio-osteohypertrophy (Klippel-Trénaunay- Weber syndrome) can be ruled out by the absence of an overlying cutaneous nevus flammeus. Neurofibromatosis may cause gross enlargement of the soft tissue and skele- ton of half the face, but it does not affect tooth size or the eruption sequence. Lymphangioma and hemangioma are characterized by soft tissue enlargement; they do not affect tooth morphology. Acromegaly produces symmetric bilat- eral jaw enlargement. Fibrous dysplasia, craniofacial dys- ostosis, and chronic inflammatory disease also should be ruled out.
Congenital hemifacial hypertrophy has been reported concomitantly with conductive hearing loss, seizure disor- ders, and Wilms’ tumor. Other syndromes and conditions that produce soft and hard tissue hypertrophy and asym- metry include Russell’s (or Russell-Silver) syndrome, con- genital lymphedema, arteriovenous aneurysms, multiple exostoses, and facial tumors of childhood.
Treatment and Prognosis
During infancy and childhood, patients should be exam- ined frequently to facilitate early identification of potential neoplasms involving the liver, adrenal glands, and kidneys. Growth and development should be observed closely for evidence of mental impairment or abnormalities of sexual development.
Abnormalities during the mixed dentition phase are re- lated to tooth size-arch size discrepancies and abnormalities
in the eruption sequence. Asymmetric growth of the cranio- facial complex and the dental alveolus requires early orth- odontic intervention, including space maintenance, minor tooth movement, and functional appliances. Surgical recon- struction of hard and soft tissue anomalies to improve func- tion and esthetics must be anticipated.
The common association of congenital hemihypertrophy with vascular anomalies, embryonal neoplasms, and mental retardation requires a multidisciplinary team of dental and medical specialists.
Clefts of the Lip and Palate
Clefts of the lip and palate are commonly encountered congenital anomalies that often result in severe functional deficits of speech, mastication, and deglutition. The preva- lence of associated congenital malformations and of learn- ing disabilities caused by hearing deficits is often increased.
Generally, clefts of the lip and palate are classified into four major types: (1) cleft lip, (2) cleft palate, (3) unilateral cleft lip and palate, and (4) bilateral cleft lip and palate. Other clefts of the lip and mouth include lip pits, linear lip indentations, submucosal clefts of the palate, bifid uvula and tongue, and numerous facial clefts extending through the nose, lips, and oral cavity. Clefting deformities are ex- tremely variable in character; they may range from furrows in the skin and mucosa to extensive cleavages involving muscle and bone. A combination of cleft lip and palate is the most commonly seen cleft deformity.
Etiology and Pathogenesis
Cleft lip and palate accounts for approximately 50% of all cases, whereas isolated cleft lip and isolated cleft pal- ate each occur in about 25% of cases. The incidence of cleft lip and cleft palate has been reported to be 1 in 700 to 1000 births, with variable racial predilection. Isolated cleft palate is less common, with an incidence of 1 in 1500 to 3000 births. Cleft lip with or without cleft pal- ate is more common in males, and cleft palate alone is more common in females.
Most cases of cleft lip and/or cleft palate can be ex- plained by the multifactorial threshold hypothesis. The multifactorial inheritance theory implies that many con- tributory risk genes interact with one another and the envi- ronment and collectively determine whether a threshold of abnormality is breached, resulting in a defect in the devel- oping fetus. Multifactorial or polygenic inheritance explains the transmission of isolated cleft lip or palate, and it is ex- tremely useful in predicting occurrence risks of this anom- aly among family members of an affected individual.
Disruption of normal patterns of facial growth, including deficiencies of any of the facial processes, may lead to mal- development of the lips and palate. Cleft lip generally occurs at about the sixth to seventh week in utero; it is a result of failure of the epithelial groove between the medial and lat- eral nasal processes to be penetrated by mesodermal cells.
Cleft palate is a result of epithelial breakdown at about the eighth week of embryonic development, with in- growth failure of mesodermal tissue and lack of lateral

palatal segment fusion. Most embryologists believe that true tissue deficiencies exist in all cleft deformities, and that actual anatomic structures are absent. Various degrees of cleft lip and palate may occur, ranging from mild notch- ing of the vermilion border or bifid uvula to severe bilateral complete clefts of the lip, alveolus, and entire palate.
Clinical Features
The Veau system of classification for cleft lip and palate is widely used by clinicians; it helps to describe the variety of lip and palatal clefts seen. This system classifies cleft lip and cleft palate separately into four major categories, with emphasis on the degree of cleft present.
Cleft lip may vary from a pit or a small notch in the vermilion border to a complete cleft extending into the floor of the nose (Figures 15-23 to 15-25). According to the Veau classification, a class I cleft of the lip is a unilateral notching of the vermilion border that does not extend into the lip. If the unilateral notching of the vermilion extends into the lip but does not involve the floor of the nose, this
• Figure 15-23 Cleft lip.
• Figure 15-24 Complete unilateral cleft extending through the alveolus and into the floor of the nose.
• Figure 15-25 Cleft (bifid) uvula.
is designated as a class II cleft. Class III lip clefts are unilat- eral clefts of the vermilion border extending through the lip into the floor of the nose. Any bilateral cleft of the lip that exhibits incomplete notching or a complete cleft is classified as a class IV cleft.
Cleft deformities of the palate can also be divided into four clinical types using the Veau system. A cleft limited to the soft palate is a class I palatal cleft. Class II clefts are defects of the hard and soft palate; they extend no further than the incisive foramen and therefore are limited to the secondary palate. Clefts of the secondary palate may be complete or incomplete. A complete cleft includes the soft and hard palate, extending to the incisive foramen. An in- complete cleft involves the velum and a portion of the hard palate, not extending to the incisive foramen. Complete unilateral clefts extending from the uvula to the incisive foramen in the midline and the alveolar process unilaterally are designated as class III palatal clefts. Class IV clefts are complete bilateral clefts involving the soft and hard palate and the alveolar process on both sides of the premaxilla, leaving it free and often mobile.
Submucosal clefts are not included in this system of clas- sification, but they can be identified clinically by the pres- ence of a bifid uvula, palpable notching of the posterior portion of the hard and soft palate, and the presence of a zona pellucida (a thin, translucent membrane) covering the defect.
Clefts of the soft palate, including submucosal clefts, are often associated with velopharyngeal incompetence or eu- stachian tube dysfunction. Recurrent otitis media and hear- ing deficits are common complications. Palatal pharyngeal incompetence results from failure of the soft palate and pharyngeal wall to make contact during swallowing and speech, which prevents the necessary muscular seal between the nasopharynx and the oropharynx. Speech is often char- acterized by air emission from the nose and has a hypernasal quality.
The prevalence of dental anomalies associated with cleft lip and palate is remarkable. Abnormalities of tooth num- ber, size, morphology, calcification, and eruption have been

well described. Both deciduous and permanent dentitions may be affected. The lateral incisor in the vicinity of the cleft is often involved, but teeth outside the cleft area ex- hibit developmental defects to a greater degree than in unaf- fected patients.
The incidence of congenitally missing teeth is high, espe- cially among deciduous and permanent maxillary lateral incisors adjacent to the alveolar cleft. The prevalence of hypodontia increases directly with the severity of the cleft. Complete unilateral and bilateral alveolar clefts are often associated with supernumerary teeth as well, usually the maxillary lateral incisors. Tooth formation is often delayed, and enamel hypoplasia, microdontia or macrodontia, and fused teeth are often seen.
Treatment and Prognosis
The prognosis is dependent on the severity of the cleft dis- order. Esthetic considerations and hearing and speech defi- cits often result in significant developmental problems.
Treatment is chronologically sequenced and often re- quires a multidisciplinary team concept because of the ex- tensive nature of the problem and its impact on the child and the immediate family. Craniofacial or cleft palate teams are made up of dental, medical, and surgical special- ists, with the assistance of allied health professionals in social services, child development, and hearing and speech therapy.
Generally, cleft lip repair is accomplished during early infancy when the child is stable, weighs at least 10 lb, and has hemoglobin levels of 10 mg/dL. Cheiloplasty is often required later in life. Orthodontic or surgically placed orthopedic devices are being used in infants to guide the dentoalveolar segments into normal anatomic relationships and to facilitate plastic surgical closure. Closure of soft palate defects with sliding or pharyngeal flaps by 1 year of age is often recommended to promote normal speech development. Palatal obturators are often fabricated for infants who have cleft palate disorders and who are having difficulty feeding or are regurgitating food or liquids through the nasal cavity. Early audiologic and speech evaluation is highly recommended, and hear- ing aids are often indicated to prevent associated learn- ing problems in children who have cleft palate and fre- quent episodes of otitis media. Chronic otitis media and associated low-frequency hearing loss are results of im- proper orientation of the eustachian tubes and inserting muscles, resulting in middle ear fluid stasis and retro- grade infection.
Preventive dental services are extremely important, be- cause an intact dentition is the foundation for future orth- odontic therapy. Treatment is often required to correct de- velopmental dental defects. Orthodontic treatment sometimes is initiated during the primary dentition to cor- rect unilateral and bilateral posterior maxillary cross-bites and to retract an anteriorly displaced premaxillary segment.
Once into the mixed dentition phase of development, conventional orthodontic therapy is initiated to establish a
normal maxillary arch form. This is often done in prepara- tion for an autogenous bone graft (commonly iliac crest) to the alveolar cleft to reestablish maxillary arch continuity. It is recommended that the grafting procedure be performed when root formation of the unerupted permanent tooth associated with the alveolar defect (usually the maxillary canine) has reached one-quarter to one-half completion. These teeth have been shown to successfully erupt passively or mechanically through the graft site, consolidating the arch, preserving the graft, and reestablishing alveolar competence.
Further orthodontic treatment, followed by orthogna- thic surgery, is often required for those patients with sig- nificant dentofacial deformities. Frequent plastic surgical procedures to correct the esthetics and function of the ver- milion border, lip, philtrum, and nose can be anticipated.
Fragile X Syndrome
It has long been recognized that among the mentally defi- cient in the general population, more men than women are affected. The large percentage of mentally disabled males and the historical documentation of families with affected male and unaffected female children are highly suggestive of an X-linked inheritance pattern. Since the report in 1943 of a family with 11 severely retarded males delivered to an ap- parently unaffected mother, multiple case reports have identified a syndrome (fragile X syndrome) characterized by X-linked mental retardation, macro-orchidism, and a char- acteristic phenotypic presentation.
Etiology and Pathogenesis
The fragile X syndrome, believed to account for 30% to 50% of all families with X-linked mental retardation, takes its name from an identifiable fragile site on the X chromosome that is a reliable diagnostic marker. It is now recognized that X-linked mental retardation may be as common as Down syndrome in males; it accounts for approximately 25% of all mentally disabled males, with an incidence of 0.3 to 1 affected child per 1000 male births. The finding of 20% to 30% of female carriers with various degrees of mental retardation may be ex- plained by lyonization or random inactivation of one of the X chromosomes.
The family history remains the primary tool for recogni- tion of patients with X-linked mental retardation. Specific cytogenetic studies can aid in the diagnosis of fragile X syndrome. In affected males, 4% to 50% (median, 20%) of cells exhibit the chromosome change, which is an abnor- mal secondary constriction near the terminal end of the long arm (q) of the X chromosome. This segment is often broken at this fragile site, hence the designation of “fragile X.” In 50% of female carriers, the fragile X chromosome cannot be detected at all. Abnormalities of speech have been noted in the fragile X syndrome, and it has been theorized that major genes related to verbal function are located on the X chromosome and are disrupted at the fragile site. Recent genetic and biochemical studies have

isolated a specific nucleotide alteration. This involves an expanded CGG repeat at one end (5') of the FMR1 gene, which in turn is related to a methylation step in the pro- duction of FMR protein. Degrees of altered methylation by way of FMR gene product may help explain the range of clinical findings.
Clinical Features
The classic clinical presentation is that of a mentally retarded male with postpubescent macro-orchidism, large ears, prog- nathism, and a long, narrow face with a high forehead and prominent supraorbital ridges (Figure 15-26). Other findings include hyperextensible joints, mitral valve prolapse, cleft pal- ate, and an association with Pierre Robin syndrome. Patients have a characteristic repetitive jocular speech and may exhibit hyperactive behavior or autism. The characteristic speech pat- tern, termed cluttering, is hurried and presents as repetitive sentences that come out in a rush. The hands are often large and fleshy, and the iris may be pale. Hand biting has been reported. Oral findings include a high-arched palate, promi- nent lateral palatine ridges, anterior and posterior dental cross-bites, and increased occlusal attrition. A high-normal birth weight is common, and an increased head circumfer- ence during infancy and childhood is noted.
The degree of mental retardation is variable, even among affected siblings. Results of testicular biopsies and endo- crine function tests are found to be within normal limits.
Treatment and Prognosis
The significance of identification of X-linked retardation in families cannot be overemphasized. Because the syndrome is inherited as an X-linked trait and the fragile X site can be identified in 30% to 50% of families with X-linked mental retardation, early diagnosis and genetic counseling are imperative.

Fragile X syndrome screening of the mentally retarded population has proved to be cost-effective. Genetic counsel- ing of families with positive histories may help to advise potential or proven carriers of the risks of bearing an af- fected child. Currently, the only reliable means of prenatal diagnosis is by examination of fetal chromosomes. There is no method of excluding carrier status in females who do not express the fragile X chromosome.
Mitral valve prolapse has been reported to occur in as many as 80% of males afflicted with this syndrome, sup- porting the need for definitive cardiac evaluation before dental therapy.

  Alterations in Size
Microdontia
In generalized microdontia, all teeth in the dentition appear smaller than normal. Teeth may actually be measurably smaller than normal, as in pituitary dwarfism, or they may be relatively small in comparison with a large mandible and maxilla.
In focal or localized microdontia, a single tooth is smaller than normal. The shape of these microdonts is often altered with the reduced size. This phenomenon is most commonly seen with maxillary lateral incisors in which the tooth crown appears cone-or peg-shaped, prompting the designation peg lateral (Figure 16-1). An autosomal-dominant inheritance pattern has been associated with this condition. Peg laterals are of no significance other than cosmetic appearance. The second most commonly seen microdont is the maxillary third molar, followed by supernumerary teeth (Figure 16-2).
Macrodontia
Generalized macrodontia is characterized by the appear- ance of enlarged teeth throughout the dentition. This may be absolute, as seen in pituitary gigantism, or it may be relative owing to a disproportionately small maxilla and mandible. The latter results in crowding of teeth and pos- sibly an abnormal eruption pattern caused by insufficient arch space.
Focal or localized macrodontia is characterized by an abnormally large tooth or group of teeth. This relatively uncommon condition usually is seen with mandibular third molars. In the rare condition known as hemifacial hypertrophy, teeth on the affected side are abnormally large compared with the unaffected side.
Alterations in Shape
Gemination
Gemination is the fusion of two teeth from a single enamel organ (Figure 16-3). The typical result is partial cleavage, with the appearance of two crowns that share the same root canal. Complete cleavage, or twinning, occasionally occurs,

resulting in two teeth from one tooth germ. Although trauma has been suggested as a possible cause, the cause of gemination is unknown. These teeth may be cosmetically unacceptable and may cause crowding.
Fusion
Fusion is the joining of two developing tooth germs, result- ing in a single large tooth structure (Figures 16-4 and 16-5).
• Figure 16-4 Fusion.
• Figure 16-5 Fusion.
The fusion process may involve the entire length of the teeth, or it may involve the roots only, in which case cemen- tum and dentin are shared. Root canals may also be separate or shared. It may be impossible to differentiate fusion of normal and supernumerary teeth from gemination. The cause of this condition is unknown, although trauma has been suggested.
Concrescence
Concrescence is a form of fusion in which adjacent, already formed teeth are joined by cementum (Figure 16-6). This may take place before or after eruption of teeth and is be- lieved to be related to trauma or overcrowding. Concres- cence is most commonly seen in association with the maxil- lary second and third molars. This condition is of no

significance, unless one of the teeth involved requires ex- traction. Surgical sectioning may be required to save the other tooth.
Dilaceration
Dilaceration is an extraordinary curving or angulation of tooth roots (Figure 16-7). The cause of this condition has been related to trauma during root development. Move- ment of the crown or of the crown and part of the root from the remaining developing root may result in sharp angula- tion after the tooth completes development. Hereditary factors are believed to be involved in a small number of cases. Eruption generally continues without problems. However, extraction may be difficult. Obviously, if root canal fillings are required in these teeth, the procedure is challenging.
Dens Invaginatus
Also known as dens in dente or tooth within a tooth, dens invaginatus is an uncommon tooth anomaly that repre- sents an exaggeration or accentuation of the lingual pit (Figures 16-8 and 16-9).
This defect ranges in severity from superficial, in which only the crown is affected, to deep, in which both the crown and the root are involved. The permanent maxillary lateral

   • Figure 16-9 Dens invaginatus of lateral incisors.
incisors are most commonly involved, although any ante- rior tooth may be affected. Bilateral involvement is com- monly seen. The cause of this developmental condition is unknown. Genetic factors are believed to be involved in only a small percentage of cases.
Because the defect cannot be kept free of plaque and bacteria, dens invaginatus predisposes the tooth to early decay and subsequent pulpitis. Prophylactic filling of the pit is recommended to avoid this complication. Because the defect may often be identified on radiographic examination before tooth eruption, the patient can be prepared in ad- vance of the procedure. In cases in which pulpitis has led to nonvitality, endodontic procedures may salvage the affected tooth.
Dens Evaginatus
Dens evaginatus is a relatively common developmental con- dition affecting predominantly premolar teeth (Leung’s premolars) (Figures 16-10 to 16-12). It has been reported

almost exclusively in Asians, Inuits, and Native Americans. The defect, which is often bilateral, is an anomalous tuber- cle, or cusp, located at the center of the occlusal surface. Because of occlusal abrasion, the tubercle wears relatively fast, causing early exposure of an accessory pulp horn that extends into the tubercle. This may result in periapical pa- thology in young, caries-free teeth, often before completion of root development and apical closure, making root canal fillings more difficult. Judicious grinding of the opposing tooth or the accessory tubercle to stimulate secondary dentin formation may prevent the periapical sequelae associated with this defect. Sealants, pulp capping, and partial pulpot- omy have been suggested as measures to allow complete root development.
Taurodontism
Taurodontism is a variation in tooth form in which teeth have elongated crowns or apically displaced furcations, re- sulting in pulp chambers that have increased apical-occlusal height (Figure 16-13). Because this abnormality resembles teeth in bulls and other ungulates, the term taurodontism was coined. Various degrees of severity may be seen, but subclassifications that have been developed to describe them appear to be of academic interest only. Taurodontism may be seen as an isolated incident, in families, and in as- sociation with syndromes such as Down syndrome and Klinefelter’s syndrome; it was also seen in the now-extinct Neanderthals. Although taurodontism is generally an un- common finding, it has been reported to have a relatively high prevalence in Eskimos, and incidence has been re- ported to be as high as 11% in a Middle Eastern popula- tion. Other than a possible relationship to other genetically determined abnormalities, taurodontism is of little clinical significance unless the tooth becomes nonvital, in which case it becomes a challenging endodontic problem. No treatment is required.
Supernumerary Roots
Accessory roots are most commonly seen in mandibular canines, premolars, and molars (especially third molars).

   • Figure 16-14 Enamel pearl.
They are rarely found in upper anterior teeth and mandibu- lar incisors. Radiographic recognition of an extraordinary number of roots becomes important when extractions or root canal fillings are necessary.
Enamel Pearls
Droplets of ectopic enamel, or so-called enamel pearls, may occasionally be found on the roots of teeth (Figure 16-14). They occur most commonly in the bifurcation or trifurca- tion of teeth but may appear on single-rooted premolar teeth as well. Maxillary molars are more commonly affected than mandibular molars. These deposits are occasionally supported by dentin and rarely may have a pulp horn ex- tending into them. This developmental disturbance of enamel formation may be detected on radiographic exami- nation. It generally is of little significance except when located in an area of periodontal disease. In such cases, it may contribute to the extension of a periodontal pocket, because a periodontal ligament attachment would not be expected and hygiene would be more difficult.
Attrition, Abrasion, Erosion
Attrition is the physiologic wearing of teeth as a result of mastication. It is an age-related process that varies from one individual to another. Factors such as diet, dentition, jaw musculature, and chewing habits can significantly influence the pattern and extent of attrition.
Abrasion is the pathologic wearing of teeth caused by an abnormal habit or abnormal use of abrasive substances orally (Figures 16-15 and 16-16). Pipe smoking, tobacco chewing, aggressive toothbrushing, and use of abrasive den- tifrices are among the more common causes. The location and pattern of abrasion are directly dependent on the cause,

with so-called toothbrush abrasion along the cementoe- namel junction an easily recognized pattern.
Erosion is the loss of tooth structure through a nonbac- terial chemical process (Figure 16-17). Most commonly, acids are involved in the dissolution process from an exter- nal or an internal source. Externally, acid may be found in the work environment (e.g., battery manufacturing) or in the diet (e.g., citrus fruits, acid-containing soft drinks). The internal source of acid is most probably regurgitation of gastric contents. This may be seen in any disorder of which

chronic vomiting is a part. Self-induced vomiting, as a com- ponent of bulimia or, less commonly, anorexia nervosa, has become an increasingly important cause of dental erosion and other oral abnormalities. The pattern of erosion associ- ated with vomiting is usually generalized tooth loss on the lingual surfaces of maxillary teeth. However, all surfaces may be affected, especially in individuals who compensate for fluid loss by excessive intake of fruit juices. In many cases of tooth erosion, no cause is found.
Alterations in Number
Anodontia
Absence of teeth is known as anodontia. This condition is further qualified as complete anodontia, when all teeth are missing; as partial anodontia or hypodontia, when one or several teeth are missing (Figure 16-18); as pseudoanodon- tia, when teeth are absent clinically because of impaction or delayed eruption; or as false anodontia, when teeth have been exfoliated or extracted. Partial anodontia is relatively common. Congenitally missing teeth are usually third mo- lars, followed by second premolars and maxillary lateral incisors. Genetic risk factors for maxillary lateral incisor agenesis have been identified and include the following genes among others: PAX9, SPRY2, SPRY4, and WNT10A.
Traditionally, hypodontia has been thought to be the result of a single dominant gene. More recent evidence us- ing two multiple-threshold models has shown that hy- podontia better fits a polygenic (caused by both environ- mental and genetic factors) rather than a single major gene model. The prevalence of any type of hypodontia in the general population is 4.6%, and there is no significant dif- ference between males and females. The prevalence of max- illary lateral incisor absence is 2.1% and is significantly lower in males than in females. The prevalence of absence of the second premolars is 1.9% for the general population, with no significant difference between males and females. These findings suggest that different forms of hypodontia may be caused by, or associated with, different gene loci or
• Figure 16-18 Anodontia of a permanent second premolar with ankylosis of an erupted primary molar.
genetic factors. However, the gene responsible for oligodon- tia or hypodontia has not yet been located.
There is a complex group of syndromes known collec- tively as ectodermal dysplasia in which complete or partial anodontia (hypodontia) is a prominent feature (Box 16-1). There are multiple modes of inheritance with most being transmitted as an X-linked recessive trait due usually to mutation of the ectodysplasin (EDA) gene. The less com- mon autosomal-dominant and recessive forms are usually associated with mutations in genes’ EDA receptor (EDAR), EDAR-associated death domain (EDARDD), and Wingless- related integration site (WNT10A). The hypodontia typi- cally seen in these syndromes is also associated with abnormal tooth morphogenesis. (Figures 16-19 and 16-20). The few

teeth that are present are microdonts and usually have a conical or peg shape. Numerous other signs and symptoms are also noted in patients with ectodermal dysplasias. Most prominent are fine and sparse hair, dystrophic nails, and exocrine gland hypoplasia (dry skin and pyrexia, xeroph- thalmia, and xerostomia). With regard to hypodontia, den- tal implants have been used to replace missing teeth with good success. Traditionally, dental prosthetics have pro- vided patients with improved esthetics and masticatory function.
Impaction
Impaction of teeth is a common event that most often affects the mandibular third molars and maxillary canines. Less commonly, premolars, mandibular canines, and second molars are involved. It is rare to see impactions of incisors and first molars. Impaction occurs because of obstruction from crowding or from some other physical barrier. Occasionally, it may be due to an abnormal erup- tion path, presumably caused by unusual orientation of the tooth germ. Ankylosis, the fusion of a tooth to surrounding bone, is another cause of impaction. This usually occurs in association with erupted primary molars. It may result in impaction of a subjacent permanent tooth. The reason for ankylosis is unknown, but it is believed to be related to periapical inflammation and subsequent bone repair. With focal loss of the periodontal ligament, bone and cementum become inextricably mixed, causing fusion of the tooth to alveolar bone.
Supernumerary Teeth
Extra, or supernumerary, teeth in the dentition most prob- ably result from continued proliferation of the permanent or primary dental lamina to form a third tooth germ (Figure 16-21). The resulting teeth may have a normal morphology or may be rudimentary and miniature. Most are isolated events, although some may be familial and others may be syndrome associated (Gardner’s syndrome and cleidocranial dysplasia). Supernumerary teeth are found
• Figure 16-21 Supernumerary premolar.
more often in the permanent dentition than in the primary dentition and are much more commonly seen in the max- illa than in the mandible (10:1). The anterior midline of the maxilla is the most common site, in which case the super- numerary tooth is known as a mesiodens (Figures 16-22 and 16-23). The maxillary molar area (fourth molar or par- amolar) is the second most common site. The significance of supernumerary teeth is that they occupy space. When they are impacted, they may block the eruption of other teeth, or they may cause delayed eruption or maleruption of adjacent teeth. If supernumerary teeth erupt, they may cause malalignment of the dentition and may be cosmeti- cally objectionable.
Teeth appearing at the time of birth are known as natal teeth, and those appearing within 6 months following birth are called neonatal teeth. Most of these teeth represent prematurely erupted deciduous teeth, usually mandibular

central incisors. A small percentage represents supernumer- ary teeth. Prematurely erupted primary teeth should be preserved (provided they cause no injury to the infant or the mother), and supernumeraries should be extracted. Not to be confused with either of these phenomena is the ap- pearance of common gingival or dental lamina cysts of the newborn.
Supernumerary teeth appearing after loss of the perma- nent teeth are known as postpermanent dentition. This is generally regarded as a rare event. Most teeth appearing after extraction of the permanent teeth are believed to arise from eventual eruption of previously impacted teeth.
Defects of Enamel
Environmental Defects of Enamel
During enamel formation, ameloblasts are susceptible to various external factors that may be reflected in erupted teeth. Metabolic injury, if severe enough and long enough, can cause defects in the quantity and shape of enamel or in the quality and color of enamel. Quantitatively defective enamel, when of normal hardness, is known as enamel hy- poplasia (Figures 16-24 and 16-25). Qualitatively defective enamel, in which normal amounts of enamel are produced

• Figure 16-25 Enamel hypoplasia believed to be caused by child- hood rickets.
• Figure 16-26 Enamel hypocalcification (Turner’s tooth).
but are hypomineralized, is known as enamel hypocalcifica- tion (Figure 16-26). In this defect, the enamel is softer than normal. The extent of the enamel defect is dependent on three conditions: (1) the intensity of the causative factor, (2) the duration of the factor’s presence, and (3) the time at which the factor occurs during crown development. Factors that lead to ameloblast damage are highly varied, although the clinical signs of defective enamel are the same.
Causative factors may occur locally, affecting only a sin- gle tooth, or they may act systemically, affecting all teeth in which enamel is being formed. Local trauma or abscess formation can adversely affect the ameloblasts overlying a developing crown, resulting in enamel hypocalcification or hypoplasia. Affected teeth may have areas of coronal discol- oration, or they may have actual pits and irregularities. This is most commonly seen in permanent teeth in which the overlying deciduous tooth becomes abscessed or is physi- cally forced into the enamel organ of the permanent tooth. The resulting hypoplastic or hypocalcified permanent tooth is sometimes known as Turner’s tooth.
For systemic factors to have an effect on developing per- manent teeth, they generally must occur after birth and

before the age of 6 years. During this time, the crowns of all permanent teeth (with the exception of the third molars) develop. Because most enamel defects affect anterior teeth and first molars, systemic factors occur predominantly dur- ing the first 18 months of life. Primary teeth and possibly the tips of first permanent molars and permanent central incisors may reflect ameloblast dysfunction occurring in utero, because these are the teeth undergoing enamel calci- fication during this period. Specific causes of systemically induced enamel defects are often obscure, but the defects usually are attributed to childhood infectious diseases. This, however, has not been well substantiated with research data. Other cited causes of enamel hypoplasia or hypocalcifica- tion include nutritional defects such as rickets, congenital syphilis, birth trauma (neonatal line in primary teeth), fluo- ride, and idiopathic factors. The enamel hypoplasia that may be seen with congenital syphilis is rather characteristic. In utero infection by Treponema pallidum affects the developing permanent incisors and first molars. Affected incisors, also known as Hutchinson’s incisors, are tapered incisally and are notched centrally on the incisal edge. Affected molars, also known as mulberry molars, show a lobulated or crenated occlusal surface.
Ingestion of drinking water containing fluoride at levels greater than 1 part per million during the time crowns are being formed may result in enamel hypoplasia or hypocalci- fication, also known as fluorosis (Figures 16-27 and 16-28).
• Figure 16-27 Fluorosis.
• Figure 16-28 Fluorosis.
Endemic fluorosis is known to occur in areas where the drinking water contains excessive naturally occurring fluo- ride. As with other causative agents, the extent of damage is dependent on duration, timing, and intensity or concentra- tion. Mild to moderate fluorosis ranges clinically from white enamel spots to mottled brown-and-white discolor- ations. Severe fluorosis appears as pitted, irregular, and dis- colored enamel. Although fluoride-induced enamel hypo- plasia or hypocalcification is caries resistant, it may be cosmetically objectionable, making esthetic dental restora- tions desirable.
Amelogenesis Imperfecta
Amelogenesis imperfecta is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders of enamel formation that affect both dentitions (Table 16-1). Most cases of amelogenesis imperfecta fall into one of two clinical types: hypoplastic or hypocalcified (Figures 16-29 to 16-31). A third type, known as hypomaturation, has been added to the list. Numerous subtypes of the three major groups are also recognized; these are based on different inheritance patterns, clinical appearances, and radiographic features.
Several genes that are involved in enamel formation (am- elogenin, enamelin, kallikrein 4, tuftelin, MMP20, and others) are mutated in various forms of this condition. The hereditary patterns range from autosomal dominant or re- cessive to X-linked dominant or recessive. Most cases of amelogenesis imperfecta are inherited as an autosomal- dominant trait, with clinical manifestations being some- what variable. Mutations in the enamelin gene are believed to be responsible for the phenotypic changes. X-linked am- elogenesis imperfecta manifests itself differently in males and females. Affected males may have a very thin, smooth enamel layer, whereas females may have thicker enamel with vertical grooves as a result of X chromosome inactiva- tion (Lyon phenomenon). The defective protein in X-linked disease has been shown to be due to mutations in the amelogenin gene.
In the hypoplastic type of amelogenesis imperfecta, teeth erupt with insufficient amounts of enamel, ranging from pits and grooves in one patient to complete absence (aplasia) in another. Because of reduced enamel thickness in some cases, abnormal contour and absent interproxi- mal contact points may be evident. In the hypocalcified type, the quantity of enamel is normal, but it is soft and friable, so that it fractures easily and wears readily. The color of the teeth varies from tooth to tooth and from patient to patient; colors include white opaque to yellow to brown. Teeth also tend to darken with age as a result of exogenous staining. Radiographically, enamel appears reduced in bulk, often showing a thin layer over occlusal and interproximal surfaces. Dentin and pulp chambers appear normal. Although the enamel is soft and irregular, teeth are not caries prone. Treatment focuses on esthetics and protection of tooth tissue. Restorative dental proce- dures at an early age not only preserve teeth, but also have a significant effect on the patient’s self-esteem.

Dentinogenesis Imperfecta
Dentinogenesis imperfecta is an autosomal-dominant trait with variable expressivity (Figures 16-32 and 16-33). Muta- tions in the dentin sialophosphoprotein gene have been de- scribed. It typically affects the dentin of both primary and permanent dentitions. Because of the clinical discoloration
• Figure 16-31 Amelogenesis imperfecta, hypocalcified type.
of teeth, this condition has also been known as (hereditary) opalescent dentin.
Dentinogenesis imperfecta has been divided into three types. In type I or syndrome-associated, in which the dentin abnormality occurs in patients with concurrent osteogenesis imperfecta, primary teeth are more severely affected than permanent teeth. In type II, patients have only dentin abnor- malities and no bone disease. In type III, or the Brandywine

• Figure 16-33 Dentinogenesis imperfecta.
type (discovered in a triracial population in Brandywine, Maryland), only dental defects occur. This type is similar to type II, but has some clinical and radiographic variations. Features of type III that are not seen in types I and II include multiple pulp exposures, periapical radiolucencies, and a variable radiographic appearance.
Dentinogenesis imperfecta has an autosomal-dominant pattern of inheritance. Dentinogenesis imperfecta type I (syndromal dentinogenesis imperfecta) is caused by muta- tions in the genes that encode collagen type I. Dentinogen- esis imperfecta types II and III, on the other hand, have been shown to be related to mutations in a gene known as dentin sialophosphoprotein that encodes noncollagen proteins of dentin. Other genes that encode dentin pro- teins, such as osteopontin, do not appear to be mutated in dentinogenesis imperfecta.
Clinically, all three types share numerous features. In both dentitions, the teeth exhibit an unusual translucent, opalescent appearance, with color variation from yellow- brown to gray. The entire crown appears discolored because of the abnormal underlying dentin. Although the enamel is structurally and chemically normal, it fractures easily, re- sulting in rapid wear. The enamel fracturing is believed to be due to the poor support provided by abnormal dentin, and possibly in part to the absence of the microscopic scal- loping normally seen between dentin and enamel, which is
believed to help mechanically lock the two hard tissues to- gether. Overall tooth morphology is unusual for its exces- sive constriction at the cementoenamel junction, giving the crowns a tulip or bell shape. Roots are shortened and blunted. The teeth do not exhibit any greater susceptibility to caries, and they may in fact show some resistance because of the rapid wear and absence of interdental contacts.
Radiographically, types I and II exhibit identical changes. Opacification of dental pulps occurs as the result of continued deposition of abnormal dentin. The short roots and the bell- shaped crowns are also obvious on radiographic examination. In type III, the dentin appears thin and the pulp chambers and root canals extremely large, giving the appearance of thin dentin shells, hence the previous designation of shell teeth.
Microscopically, the dentin of teeth in dentinogenesis imperfecta contains fewer, but larger and irregular, dentinal tubules. The pulpal space is nearly completely replaced over time by irregular dentin. Enamel appears normal, but the dentinoenamel junction is smooth instead of scalloped.
Treatment is directed toward protecting tooth tissue from wear and tear, thereby improving the esthetic appear- ance of the teeth. Generally, fitting with full crowns at an early age is the treatment of choice. Despite the qualita- tively poor dentin, support for the crowns is adequate. These teeth should not be used as abutments because the roots are prone to fracture under stress.
Dentin Dysplasia
Dentin dysplasia, subdivided into types I and II, is an- other autosomal-dominant condition that affects dentin (Figures 16-34 and 16-35). The incidence of this rare dis- order is approximately 10 times less than that of dentino- genesis imperfecta. As in dentinogenesis imperfecta II and III, genetic mutations occur in the dentin sialophospho- protein gene in dentin dysplasia type II. Genetic lesions have yet to be elucidated in dentin dysplasia type I.
In dentin dysplasia type II, the color of the primary denti- tion is opalescent and the permanent dentition is normal; in type I, both dentitions are of normal color. The coronal pulps in type II are usually large (thistle tube appearance) and are filled with globules of abnormal dentin. Also, periapical le- sions are not a regular feature of type II, as they are of type I.

 • Figure 16-35 Dentin dysplasia type II. Note horizontal ribbons (chevrons) of dental pulp.
Clinically, the crowns in dentin dysplasia type I appear to be normal in color and shape. Premature tooth loss may occur because of short roots or periapical inflammatory lesions. Teeth show greater resistance to caries compared with normal teeth.
Radiographically, in dentin dysplasia type I, roots appear extremely short and pulps are almost completely obliter- ated. Residual fragments of pulp tissue appear typically as horizontal lucencies (chevrons). Periapical lucencies are typically seen; they represent chronic abscesses, granulomas, or cysts. In dentin dysplasia type II, deciduous teeth are similar in radiographic appearance to those in type I, but permanent teeth exhibit enlarged pulp chambers that have been described as thistle tube in appearance.
Microscopically, the enamel and the immediately sub- jacent dentin appear normal. Deeper layers of dentin show atypical tubular patterns, with amorphous atubular areas and irregular organization. On the pulpal side of the normal-appearing mantle of dentin, globular or nodular masses of abnormal dentin are seen.
Treatment is directed toward retention of teeth for as long as possible. However, because of the short roots and periapical lesions, the prognosis for prolonged retention is poor. This dental condition has not been associated with any systemic connective tissue problems.
Defects of Enamel and Dentin
Regional Odontodysplasia
Regional odontodysplasia is a dental abnormality that in- volves the hard tissues derived from both epithelial (enamel) and mesenchymal (dentin and cementum) components of the tooth-forming apparatus (Figures 16-36 and 16-37). The teeth in a region or quadrant of the maxilla or mandi- ble are affected to the extent that they exhibit short roots, open apical foramina, and enlarged pulp chambers. The thinness and poor mineralization quality of the enamel and dentin layers have given rise to the term ghost teeth. One or both dentitions may be affected. The permanent teeth are more affected than the primary teeth, and the maxillary anterior teeth are more affected than other teeth. Eruption of the affected teeth is delayed or does not occur.
  
www.konkur.in
   • Figure 16-36 Regional odontodysplasia, left maxilla.
• Figure 16-37 Regional odontodysplasia (ghost teeth).
The cause of this rare dental abnormality is unknown, although numerous causative factors have been suggested, including trauma, nutritional deficiency, infection, meta- bolic abnormality, systemic disease, local vascular compro- mise, and genetic influences.
Because of the poor quality of the affected teeth, their removal is usually indicated. The resulting edentulous zone can then be restored with a prosthesis or implant.
Abnormalities of Dental Pulp
Pulp Calcification
Pulp calcification is a rather common phenomenon that occurs with increasing age for no apparent reason (Figures 16-38 and 16-39). There appears to be no rela- tion to inflammation, trauma, or systemic disease. Pulp calcification may be of microscopic size or may be large enough to be detected radiographically. Calcifications may be diffuse (linear) or nodular (pulp stones). The dif- fuse, or linear, deposits are typically found in the root canals and generally are parallel to the blood vessels. Pulp stones usually are found in the pulp chamber. When they are composed predominantly of dentin, they are referred
• Figure 16-38 Pulp calcification, diffuse.
• Figure 16-39 Pulp calcification. Pulp stones are evident in the molars.
to as true denticles; when they represent foci of dystro- phic calcification, they are referred to as false denticles. Pulp stones occasionally are subdivided into attached and free types, depending on whether they are incorporated into the dentin wall or are surrounded by pulpal tissue.
Pulp stones appear to have no clinical significance. They are not believed to be a source of pain and are not associated with any form of pulpitis. They may, however, be problem- atic during endodontic therapy of nonvital teeth.
Internal Resorption
Resorption of the dentin of the pulpal walls may be seen as part of an inflammatory response to pulpal injury, or it may be seen in cases in which no apparent trigger can be identi- fied (Figures 16-40 and 16-41). The resorption occurs as a result of activation of osteoclasts or dentinoclasts on internal surfaces of the root or crown. Resorption lacunae containing these cells and chronic inflammatory cells are seen. Reversal lines may also be found in adjacent hard tissue, indicating attempts at repair. In time, the root or crown is perforated by the process, making the tooth useless.
Any tooth may be involved, and usually only a single tooth is affected, although cases in which more than one tooth is involved have been described. In advanced cases, teeth may appear pink because of the proximity of pulp tis- sue to the tooth surface. Until root fracture or communica- tion with a periodontal pocket occurs, patients generally have no symptoms.
The treatment of choice is root canal therapy before per- foration. Once communication between pulp and peri- odontal ligament occurs, the prognosis for saving the tooth is very poor. Occasionally, the process may spontaneously stop for no apparent reason.

    • Figure 16-40 Internal resorption.
• Figure 16-41 Internal resorption. External Resorption
Resorption of teeth from external surfaces may have one of several causes (Figures 16-42 to 16-46). This change may be the result of an adjacent pathologic process, such as (1) chronic inflammatory lesions, (2) cysts, (3) benign tu- mors, or (4) malignant neoplasms. The pathogenesis of ex- ternal resorption from these causes has been related to the release of chemical mediators, increased vascularity, and pressure. External resorption of teeth may also be seen in association with (1) trauma, (2) reimplantation or trans- plantation of teeth, or (3) impaction. Trauma that causes injury to or necrosis of the periodontal ligament may initiate resorption of tooth roots. This trauma may result from a single event, from malocclusion, or from excessive

orthodontic forces. Because reimplanted and transplanted teeth are nonvital and have no surrounding viable peri- odontal ligament, they eventually are resorbed and replaced by bone. This is basically a natural physiologic process in which the calcified collagen matrix of the tooth serves as a framework for the deposition of new, viable bone. Impacted teeth, when they impinge or exert pressure on adjacent teeth, may cause root resorption of the otherwise normally erupted tooth. Impacted teeth themselves occasionally may undergo resorption. The cause of this phenomenon is unknown, although it is believed to be related to partial loss of the protective effect of the periodontal ligament or reduced enamel epithelium.
Finally, external resorption of erupted teeth may be idio- pathic. This may occur in one or more teeth. Any tooth may be involved, although molars are least likely to be af- fected. One of two patterns may be seen. In one, resorption occurs immediately apical to the cementoenamel junction, mimicking a pattern of caries associated with xerostomia. In external resorption, however, the lesions occur on root surfaces below the gingival epithelial attachment. In the other pattern of external resorption, the process starts at the tooth apex and progresses occlusally.
External resorption is a particularly frustrating type of dental abnormality for both patients and practitioners be- cause there is no plausible or evident explanation for the condition and no effective treatment. Over an extended clinical course, resorption eventually causes loss of the affected tooth.
Alterations in Color
Exogenous Stains
Stains on the surfaces of teeth that can be removed with abrasives are known as exogenous or extrinsic stains. The color change may be caused by substances in the diet (e.g., coffee, tea, wine) or associated with habits (e.g., “betel” areca nut, tobacco products). Colored byproducts of chromogenic bacteria in dental plaque may also cause exogenous staining. Chromogenic bacteria are believed to be responsible for
brown, black, green, and orange stains observed predomi- nantly in children. Brown and black stains typically are seen in the cervical zone of teeth, either as a thin line along the gingival margin or as a wide band. This type of stain is also often found on teeth adjacent to salivary duct orifices. Green stain is tenacious and usually is found as a band on the labial surfaces of the maxillary anterior teeth. Blood pig- ments are thought to contribute to the green color. Orange or yellow-orange stains appear on the gingival third of teeth in a small percentage of children. These generally are easily removed.
Endogenous Stains
Discoloration of teeth resulting from deposits of systemi- cally circulating substances during tooth development is defined as endogenous or intrinsic staining.
Systemic ingestion of tetracycline during tooth develop- ment is a well-known cause of endogenous staining of teeth (Figure 16-47). Tetracycline binds calcium and therefore is deposited in developing teeth and bones. The bright yellow color of the drug is reflected in subsequently erupted teeth. The fluorescent property of tetracycline can be demon- strated with an ultraviolet light in clinically erupted teeth. Over time, the tetracycline oxidizes, resulting in a change from yellow to gray or brown with loss of its fluorescent quality. Because tetracycline can cross the placenta, it may stain primary teeth if taken during pregnancy. If it is ad- ministered between birth and age 6 or 7 years, permanent teeth may be affected. Only a small minority of children given tetracycline for various bacterial diseases, however, exhibit clinical evidence of discoloration. Staining is di- rectly proportional to the age at which the drug is adminis- tered and the dose and duration of drug usage.
The significance of tetracycline staining lies in its cos- metically objectionable appearance. Because other, equally effective antibiotics are available, tetracycline should not be prescribed for children younger than 7 years except in unusual circumstances.
It should be noted that minocycline, a semisynthetic derivative of tetracycline, can stain the roots of adult teeth.
• Figure 16-47 Tetracycline stain. Note the yellow color (tetracy- cline) of the posterior teeth and the gray color of the anterior teeth, in which oxidation of endogenous tetracycline has occurred.

It also may stain skin and mucosa in a diffuse or patchy pattern (see Chapter 5).
Rh incompatibility (erythroblastosis fetalis) has been cited as a cause of endogenous staining in primary teeth. Because of red blood cell hemolysis resulting from maternal antibody destruction of fetal red blood cells, blood break- down products (bilirubin) are deposited in developing pri- mary teeth. The teeth appear green to brown. Treatment is not required because only primary teeth are affected.
Congenital porphyria, one of several inborn errors of porphyrin metabolism, is also a potential cause of endoge- nous pigmentation. This autosomal-recessive trait is associ- ated with photosensitivity, vesiculobullous skin eruptions, red urine, and splenomegaly. Teeth may appear red to brown because of deposition of porphyrin in the developing teeth. Affected teeth fluoresce red with ultraviolet light.
Liver disease, biliary atresia, and neonatal hepatitis may produce discoloration of the primary dentition. In biliary atresia, the teeth may assume a green discoloration; a yellowish-brown color is noted in cases of neonatal hepati- tis. This is a result of the deposition or incorporation of bilirubin in developing enamel and dentin.
