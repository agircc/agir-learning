        - |
          You are a dental nurse performing a clinical dental examination with imaging.

          Please generate a detailed dental examination report that includes:
          - Type of procedures performed (e.g., intraoral X-rays, panoramic radiographs, oral imaging)
          - At least 3 realistic clinical findings using professional dental terminology
          - Observations should relate to common dental issues such as:
            • Dental caries (e.g., occlusal, interproximal)
            • Root infections (e.g., periapical abscess)
            • Periodontal conditions (e.g., bone loss, gingival recession)
            • Impacted or fractured teeth
            • Any anomalies in root or crown morphology
          - The tone should be clinical and concise, suitable for a dentist's review.

          Format your response as a structured dental report.
          Do NOT include any explanation or extra metadata — only the report content.
